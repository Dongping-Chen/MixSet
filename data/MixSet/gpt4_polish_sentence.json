Bethany and I were up watching movies until past 3:00 a.m. last night; it seems we've been indulging in quite a few films recently. To give you an idea, last night included \"Thirteen,\" a film I'd argue is essential viewing for any mother of a teenager\u2014it surpassed my expectations. Following that, we braved \"Gigli,\" which, regrettably, lived up to its poor reviews in the media, but curiosity got the better of us."

However, this season is different; two captivating new shows have captured my attention, and for the past week, I've been watching them with great devotion. \"Blow Out\" presents a paradoxically flamboyant concept in which, surprisingly, not a single gay person appears to be in sight. The show centers on hairstylist Jonathan Antin\u2019s ambitious plan to expand his wildly successful West Hollywood salon by establishing a second outlet in Beverly Hills. Typically, such a venture wouldn't pique my interest\u2014certainly not mine. But as I was channel-surfing, I stumbled upon a scene of Jonathan\u2014both narcissistic and uninspired\u2014surveying an empty storefront on Rodeo Drive. He dramatically declared, in a tone meant for the public, \"I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world, ever!\" And just like that, I was hooked. Not since the show \"The Restaurant\" with Rocco DiSpirito have I found such a fascinatingly foolish character to make for such compelling television."

Here are a few examples for your consideration: purchase 36 permanent markers and receive a stunt kite, or buy 30 lever arch files and be rewarded with a barbecue."

I'm also delighted that I don't have to work this morning\u2014though I must remember to call a contact at KMIZ for his rate card. This evening, I'm excited to catch up with two of my dearest friends, Amy and Kate, and hopefully I'll find some time to study as well. Tomorrow, I'm looking forward to possibly reconnecting with someone I haven't seen in a long time for our Weight Watchers date."

By gary fineout and alfonso chardy the citizenship ceremony in jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new americans. Just before the new citizens left the june 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table -- a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those handing out forms were republican volunteers -- and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the gop. All of it was suspicious to linda cross, who was there to watch her husband, dario cruz, take his citizenship oath.",

Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy report that at a citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville, which saw nearly 200 individuals becoming new Americans, an unusual incident occurred. An immigration official, while directing the swearing-in, encouraged the attendees to visit a voter registration table before departing the June 29th event. Such tables are commonly seen at naturalization ceremonies; however, this one stood out because it was manned by Republican volunteers who had preemptively marked the party affiliation box to enlist the new citizens as GOP members. This raised suspicions for Linda Cross, who witnessed her husband, Dario Cruz, take his oath of citizenship."

As a non-american blogger i've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since i started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) i suppose i'd better say something. Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.",

By granting a symbol - any symbol - such unyielding respect and protection, we edge closer to a form of authoritarianism. Symbols are inherently mercurial; they hold no intrinsic meaning.

These modifications have introduced a combination of soft and hard price caps that have led to a significant and troubling disconnect within our market. This breakdown presents an unacceptable level of risk to all participants and is unlikely to achieve the ISO's goal of reducing real-time energy sales and procurement costs. Instead of mitigating prices, the current situation may inadvertently cause suppliers to continue opting for the more favorable pricing opportunities offered by the ISO. This unintended consequence is problematic for the integrity and predictability of our market. In response to this challenge, the PX is actively seeking intervention. We are petitioning Terry Winter from the ISO to promptly permit the submission of adjustment bids at any price on all schedules, without restriction. This measure is critical to restoring stability and continuity in the auction market. We understand the gravity of this matter and are fully committed to finding a resolution that safeguards the interests of our market participants. Sincerely, John Yurkanin\nChief Operating Officer"

I want to update you regarding our ongoing discussions with Deutsche Bank, specifically about two credit-related issues: 1. In terms of the language proposed for the cross-default clause, the bank wishes to insert a provision stating that a cross-default should not be triggered automatically. Instead, it suggests that a cross-default should only occur if the non-defaulting party, in exercising good faith, determines that the defaulting party's ability to perform its obligations under the master agreement is in jeopardy. 2. Regarding the credit event upon merger, we have previously raised concerns about their use of the \"materially weaker\" standard. We have recommended more precise language, proposing that a credit event is triggered if the entity involved is downgraded below 'BBB-' by Standard & Poor's. Are you in agreement with this stance, or do you have an alternate perspective? Please share your thoughts on these matters when convenient. Warm regards,\nCarol St. Clair"

        "gpt4_polish_sentence_output": "Ahimsa (uh-him-sah), a noun, embodies the principle of refraining from causing harm to living beings. Derived from Sanskrit, \"ahimsa\" combines the negative prefix 'a-' with 'himsa', meaning injury, stemming from 'himsati', which translates to 'he injures'. \"As my understanding of ahimsa deepened, I grew increasingly attentive to my thoughts and words. Thus, I found certain lines of the anthem disturbing; specifically, 'Scatter her enemies and make them fall; confound their policies, frustrate their knavish tricks', which sharply conflicted with my developing sense of ahimsa,\" reflected M.K. Gandhi in 'The Story of My Experiments with Truth' (1927). Today, October 2nd, marks the birth of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in 1869. While a man born over a century and a half ago may seem distant and unrelated to the modern era, Gandhi's life and teachings remain profoundly relevant and continue to resonate with us today."

I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo.",

I have a general distaste for prequels as they inherently move backward in the storyline rather than forward, a common issue across the board. Despite this, prequels do enrich the overall narrative. However, the combat mechanics lack the precision and refinement found in Arkham City, resulting in a somewhat sloppy experience. At the time of writing this review (October 26, 2013), there is a significant glitch that halts the completion of a particular side mission\u2014though, fortunately, it does not impact the main story.

The upgrade system itself is well-calibrated, avoiding any feeling of tedium once familiarized. Ammunition limitations and elemental factors encourage the strategic use of diverse weaponry.

Neutral Point: \n\u00b1 Not particularly positive or negative, but for those interested, the protagonist you create is mute. Now, for my thoughts: I absolutely adore this game. It's probably one of the best RPGs\u2014or even games\u2014I've ever played. So, if you're an RPG enthusiast, you likely already own this game."

The voice actors for optimus, megatron, bumblebee, and many others are back, and instantly recognisable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is there. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster.",

The iconic voice actors behind Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, and numerous others have returned, their voices immediately recognizable. The signature transformation sound effect from the cartoons is unmistakably present. Visually, the cel-shaded aesthetic is spot-on, encapsulating the essence of Generation One. Beyond the nostalgic elements, the game is genuinely entertaining. Its combat system is finely tuned, with strategic transformations during battles often being crucial, blending fluidly into the combat sequences \u2014 a dynamic departure from High Moon Studios' acclaimed 'War for Cybertron' and 'Fall of Cybertron' titles. Notably, the game leans heavily into melee combat, though certain opponents, such as the Seekers, necessitate a shift to ranged weaponry."

Restarting the client seems to resolve this issue. What puzzles me, though, is the requirement to link my Steam and Gface accounts ostensibly for downloadable content (DLC) access. Why is this linkage mandatory? Moreover, this integration is irreversible, leaving me uncomfortable about an unfamiliar company having access to my Steam information. As for the game itself, it's mediocre at best. It's clearly trying to emulate Call of Duty, yet it manages to degrade the quality of gunplay even further. How they achieved this regression is truly baffling."

Traditionally, I would recommend using a gamepad for the best experience; however, I found the keyboard and mouse setup to be quite satisfactory as well. Rest assured, both control schemes are fully customizable. The pricing feels appropriate, and I believe it would be a purchase well worth the investment. Players will be pleased to know that more than half the DLC is included at no additional cost, offering a substantial amount of extra content to enjoy.

Imo, this is a really great and fun game in truth, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)",

The 'dual play' segments\u2014where one can control both Batman and an additional character\u2014were a highlight for me. Moreover, the flexibility to use a controller for most parts of the game and switch to a mouse and keyboard for tank combat was a welcome feature.

I had my doubt about the navel combat system, but it is so much fun to lay waste to multiple fleets at a time! the only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat looks overwhelming just get outta there, regroup, and counter-assault. Thanks, devs, for an awesome experience!",

I eagerly anticipate every battle, which have been finely tuned for an excellent combat experience. Initially, I was skeptical about the naval combat system, but it turns out to be thrilling to decimate entire fleets simultaneously! In this game, the only route to defeat is a failure to retreat. If a battle seems too intense, just pull back, regroup, and plan a strategic counterattack. A heartfelt shoutout to the developers for crafting such an outstanding gaming experience!"

Even now, I find myself returning to it when boredom strikes, relishing the chance to revisit the origins of what has become an iconic title.

Players harness the power of portals to navigate complex puzzles, involving buttons that trigger various elements within the game's environment.

I've also observed a noticeable degradation in draw distances post-patch 1.03, with objects and even characters popping up abruptly when approached too closely. Regardless, setting aside these technical issues, The Witcher 3 is a truly exceptional game. The developers have invested considerable effort into crafting quests that are both emotionally resonant and profound. There's a wealth of side quests, and the impactful nature of player decisions significantly enhances the experience.

After those few enjoyable hours you'll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in it's combat, enemies and game play. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually. Though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding.

As a casual game, it's decent, but it's unlikely to captivate you for more than a couple of months unless you have a particular affinity for grinding.

I loved that game however, it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right. As for xcom2 i love it, the game plays pretty well for me on medium and i am running a gtx560 with 2gb of vram. At first the game set it to high and it was running a bit sluggishly but not to the point of being unplayable but when i dropped it down to medium it smoothed on out.

Despite its challenging nature in the beginning, the game captivated me with its rewarding gameplay dynamics when strategies were successfully executed. Regarding \"XCOM 2,\" I'm thoroughly enjoying it. The game performs quite well on a medium setting on my system, which is equipped with a GTX560 with 2GB of VRAM. Initially, the game automatically set itself to high, leading to slight performance lag, but not to the extent of being unplayable. After adjusting the settings down to medium, the gameplay became much smoother. It might be luck, but I generally don't encounter the issues others seem to experience with games. It appears to me that many of the negative reviews may stem from overly demanding expectations."

Nevertheless, helicity selection rules present in diboson scattering amplitudes act as a barrier, diminishing the expected interference contributions from dimension-six operators and resulting in the leading contributions to the overall diboson rate correction being negated. However, precise measurements of the azimuthal decay angles can restore visibility to this interference, thereby regaining sensitivity to those operators initially deemed non-interfering. Our detailed investigation into these phenomena reveals that uncertainties related to effective field theory, arising from higher-dimensional operators, are significantly mitigated by constructing an asymmetry variable. This variable, which arises solely due to non-interfering operators, effectively minimizes the influence of the interfering, higher-dimensional operators, relegating their effects to a level comparable to statistical errors in the measurement."

The introduction of the term \"data science\" provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in such a way that it naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we organize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task.

The standard lore is that these particles are introduced to ensure that extremal black holes are either unstable or marginally stable, but it is not clear what is wrong if this doesn't happen. This note shows that, for a generic einstein quantum theory of gravity in ads, exactly stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy. Avoiding the contradiction leads to a nonperturbative version of the wgc, which reduces to the usual statement at weak coupling. The argument is general, and it does not rely on either supersymmetry or a particular uv completion, assuming only the validity of einsteinian gravity, effective field theory, and holography.",

This brief demonstrates that, within a generic Einstein quantum gravity framework in AdS spaces, the exact stability of extremal black branes conflicts with well-established quantum information theorems concerning entanglement entropy. To reconcile this discrepancy, we propose a nonperturbative formulation of the WGC, which converges with the familiar hypothesis in the regime of weak coupling.

We construct a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. We contrast our approach with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration to reveal that only the bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. Our simulations and real data example for a survey of business establishments demonstrate the utility of our approach across different modeling formulations and sampling designs. This work serves as a capstone for recent developmental efforts that combine traditional survey estimation approaches with the bayesian modeling paradigm and provides a bridge across the two rich but disparate sub-fields.",

To address this issue, we have developed a weight-exponentiated formulation for the distribution of random effects, ensuring unbiased inference when determining the hyperparameters associated with these effects.

In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase. However, a primordial eccentricity could alternatively be caused by instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any planets.",

A slight adjustment to this model can account for thinner belts if the planetesimals already possess an initial eccentricity, potentially imparted by planetary disturbances during the earlier, gas-rich stage of the protoplanetary disk.

What captures my interest, however, is whether there is validity to this notion. Indeed, for certain activities such as emailing at the dinner table, texting while driving, or even live-tweeting during a TED talk, the adage seems self-evident. Yet, I contend that for a significant category of endeavor, engaging in two, three, or even four tasks simultaneously might be precisely what we ought to strive for. Consider Albert Einstein in 1905, who astounding published not one, but four groundbreaking scientific papers."

It is a foundational aspect of human existence, yet it's often deemed an 'embarrassing' topic to discuss openly. Through personal encounters and the shared experiences of the women in my circle, I can attest to the fatigue. The covert maneuver of sneaking a sanitary pad out of a nondescript brown paper bag, tucking it away into a pocket during a class, and then stealthily heading to the restroom is draining. Moreover, enduring classes and meetings while feigning normalcy amidst the throes of intense period pain is a silent ordeal many women know all too well."

On the other hand, they typically regard thinking as far simpler: a matter of logical reasoning, clear-cut and not nearly as perplexing. However, this is a misconception. Consider the following dilemmas. An intriguing issue is our approach to health.

Sperm donors are commonly labeled as \"biological fathers,\" yet is it appropriate to use the term \"father\"? As both a philosopher and social scientist, I have explored these intricate questions surrounding the concept of parenthood. Today, I plan to share with you the insights I've gleaned from engaging with both parents and children.

Amidst cheers, I recognize not only these identities but also a man who served six years in state prison, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island, for an offense that nearly took another's life. My journey from confinement to where I stand now was not propelled by the severity of punishment endured in adult prison, nor by the stringency of our legal system. Instead, it was the transformative power of education within the classroom walls, revealing pathways I never imagined possible for myself or within our justice system. A few weeks before my parole release, a counselor suggested I sign up for a newly introduced college course in prison, advice that would alter the course of my life."
