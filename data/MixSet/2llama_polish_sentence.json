Ah, robert rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? it'll come to you... 2.

It's worth noting that Rubin's reputation for fiscal prudence is well-deserved; indeed, naming another Bush administration official with similar gravitas on domestic policy matters is a challenge. The second issue is that granting Republicans control solely during wartime is untenable since they've cleverly conjured up a never-ending, global \"War on Terror\" pretext."

While it was clever, well-paced and altogether very convincing, i must confess that i failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, i guess.",
        "llama_polish_sentence_output": "This past weekend was enjoyable. After a lengthy hiatus, I indulged in copious amounts of quality time with nature, listening to Nevermore (which I should have done sooner) and immersing myself in reading. Over the course of three days, I completed Bruce Sterling's \"Heavy Weather,\" Larry Niven's \"World of Ptavvs,\" and Octavia Butler's \"Parable of the Sower.\" \"Heavy Weather\" offered a captivating cyberpunk adventure set in a dystopian future USA ravaged by global warming and chaos. Although the novel showcased impressive craftsmanship, a brisk pace, and engaging characters, I didn't experience any profound emotional connections to the narrative or its cast. It's undeniably a solid book, but doesn't quite reach greatness, in my opinion."

However, I intervened and suggested that we approach the administrator first to address our concerns in a more constructive manner."

As a non-american blogger i've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since i started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) i suppose i'd better say something. Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.",

First and foremost, I believe that the notion of enacting laws against flag-burning is utterly misguided. By granting symbols such automatic reverence and protection, we take a subtle yet significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are inherently ephemeral - their meanings are not innate but rather shaped by perceptions and interpretations."

        "llama_polish_sentence_output": "The concept of ahimsa, which means 'noninjury to living beings,' has been a guiding principle in my life. Derived from the Sanskrit words 'a-' meaning 'not' and 'himsati' meaning 'he injures,' ahimsa encourages us to avoid causing harm to any living being. As I grew older, my understanding of ahimsa deepened, and I became increasingly mindful of my thoughts and words. In fact, certain phrases in our national anthem, such as 'scatter her enemies and make them fall' and 'confound their policies, frustrate their knavish tricks,' have always resonated deeply with me, as they align with my belief in ahimsa. Mahatma Gandhi, who was born on this day, October 2nd, in 1869, also embraced the principles of ahimsa throughout his life.

        "llama_polish_sentence_output": "Magic fans, beware! Wizards is hesitant to create a quality digital game that truly captures the essence of Magic: The Gathering. At its core, Magic is a social experience meant to be enjoyed with friends or rivals, where laughter, trash talk, and game-winning moves are essential. Unfortunately, Wizards of the Coast appears to have overlooked this aspect. If you opt to play with companions, you won't earn gold, which is a crucial component. Gold is so vital that a daily cap has been put in place, understandably, since it unlocks all in-game content. However, prepare for a tedious and solitary 1v1 grind against AI opponents or strangers, without the possibility of communication. Alternatively, playing for free will require approximately four hours per day for several weeks, spent alone, to obtain the desired cards."

I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo.",

While I appreciate the additional storyline depth that prequels offer, I generally dislike them because they move the narrative backward instead of forward. Moreover, the combat mechanics in Arkham Origins feel somewhat clumsy and lack the precision that Arkham City delivered so well. At the time of writing (October 26, 2013), a game-breaking bug hinders the completion of a side mission, although the main story remains unaffected. Furthermore, some gadgets are assigned to awkward key bindings, forcing me to stretch my fingers across the entire keyboard during combat, which can disrupt my combos.\" "

The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the important word here while comparing sw2 to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 borderlands' formula of 'rng' weapons) weapons that stay viable through most of the game.

Enemies pose a reasonable challenge, provided players manage elemental and upgrade aspects effectively. The upgrade system boasts impressive balance, becoming less tiresome after familiarization. Innovative weapon variety remains useful throughout the game, setting Shadow Warrior apart from Borderlands' randomized arsenal. Additionally, the soundtrack features memorable tracks, including the iconic main theme and Stan Bush's contributions."

I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much much better as you play (i think this is with every ac game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so was all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this ac game that i never got from any of the previous ones and maybe its because i felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They def were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way.",

Although the narrative begins on a rocky note, it significantly improves as the game progresses - a common trait among AC games, in my opinion. Additionally, the supporting cast is intriguing, and I found Edward to be a compelling character. One aspect that sets this game apart is how collectibles serve a greater purpose and offer a sense of accomplishment without feeling obligatory. While they aren't essential, obtaining them is enjoyable, and the rewards are well-balanced, further enhancing the gaming experience."

Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster.",

The signature transformation sound effects are also unmistakably Generation One. Visually, the cel-shaded graphics are flawless, capturing the retro feel without any compromise. While the game may seem like a mere throwback at first glance, its combat mechanics deserve high praise. Transformation plays a crucial role in combat, often requiring you to change forms mid-battle, which flows smoothly into combination attacks. Unlike High Moon's War for/Fall of Cybertron titles, this game emphasizes melee combat, although certain foes, such as Seekers, demand a strategic shift to ranged weaponry."

The gameplay was engaging and challenging, and I discovered a lot about myself through the experience - including my previously unknown fear of heights, which was triggered by the nerve-wracking ice caverns! Despite the anxiety it caused me, I persevered for Uncle Fred's sake, and I'm thrilled that I did. If there's ever a DLC or sequel, I'll be the first in line to purchase it and recommend it to all my friends. Kudos to every single person involved in creating this masterpiece; you've crafted a truly exceptional gaming experience."

In previous games you were set on the earth's timeline going through periods like the stone age, medieval age, and the modern age; however, in this game you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What i enjoy about this game is 2k took a new approach to the game and added some new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What i didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics the game could be overwhelming at times.

One aspect I appreciate about this game is how 2K Games introduced fresh mechanics, such as the affinity system and orbital layer, providing a unique twist to the series.

I purchased it thinking it would be similar to 'Katamari Damacy,' a beloved PS2 game, but it fell short of my expectations. The gameplay involves growing larger by absorbing objects, but the experience is marred by clunky controls and unimaginative level design. Moreover, the game's atmosphere is eerie and unsettling, with lifeless animations that resemble taxidermied specimens rather than living creatures. The whole experience left me feeling dejected and questioning the purpose of existence.\" "

I thought, 'oh wow! a simulator of the road to becoming president! that sounds fun!' well, it really wasn't. The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: republican or democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little dissapointed, but still optimistic, i carried on to see what i could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with.

My initial reaction was, \"Wow, this sounds like fun!\" However, my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when I realized that the game forces players to choose between Republican or Democrat, with no option for independence or third-party affiliation. Despite this limitation, I decided to continue playing to see what else the game had to offer. One aspect that surprised me was the character customization feature, which allowed me to create a personalized avatar. Although the options were somewhat restricted, it was entertaining to experiment with different looks. Notably, it was the only time during the game where I had the freedom to decide whether or not to wear a hat - a minor detail that added some humor to the experience."

This comes as 30 large-scale construction projects, including the Xiluodu Dam, were ordered to cease operations due to a lack of proper environmental checks. While most projects have complied with the shutdown order, the China Three Gorges Project Corp remains steadfast in its refusal to do so, even ignoring similar orders for its Three Gorges Underground Power Plant and Three Gorges Project Electrical Power Supply Plant. As of now, only 22 of the 30 projects targeted by China's State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) have complied with the directive."

Ultimately, the goal is to establish robust links between individual phonons of vibration and single photons propagating in the guided modes of the PCW, paving the way for quantum optomechanics involving atoms, photons, and phonons."

The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, draws a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required and a proper selection of the amount of smoothing, governing the shape of the density and hence possibly the modal structure, is crucial to identify the final partition.

This approach's nonparametric formulation, dubbed modal clustering, establishes a relationship between the groups and the attractor regions of the density modes. To operationalize modal clustering, a nonparametric density estimate is necessary, and selecting the appropriate amount of smoothing, which influences the density's shape and potentially the modal configuration, is critical in determining the ultimate partition.

The agents can be divided into several groups in each of which the agents have similar (isomorphic) state transition structures, and thus can be relabeled into the same template. Based on the template a scalable supervisor whose state size and computational cost are independent of the number of agents is designed for the case of partial observation. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not need to be recomputed regardless of how many agents are added to or removed from the system. We generalize our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor on the template level.

An efficient approach for enf estimation is introduced with temporal windowing based on the filter-bank capon spectral estimator. A type of gohberg-semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is used due to the toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. Moreover, this approach uses, for the first time in the field of enf, a temporal window, not necessarily the rectangular one, at the stage preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are employed for fast implementation of matrix inversions.

However, since we've all had to address a crowd at some point, it's essential to learn how to cope with this fear. To begin, let's recognize what stage fright is. As social creatures, humans are programmed to anxiously guard their reputation. When we speak in public, there's a lingering concern that our words might damage our image, leaving us feeling exposed and vulnerable. The thought of embarrassment looms large before a speech, as we worry, \"What if they think I'm terrible? What if I come across as an idiot?\""

[the way we work]around 15 percent of american workers don't have traditional full-time jobs. They're half-time, part-time, contract workers or temps. The term \"side hustle\" just seems to fit with this ethos where people are putting together a few different things to make a living.the word \"side hustle\" has its roots in popular african american newspapers. In the 1920s, these papers used the word \"hustle\" to refer to some kind of scam. By the 1950s, they were using \"side hustle\" to refer to legitimate work, too. A side hustle is a little different than a second job. A second job is about necessity.",
        "llama_polish_sentence_output": "It's hard to imagine someone having only one interest in life that they want to pursue forever. Instead, many Americans diversify their professional lives, with around 15% of workers holding non-traditional jobs such as part-time, temporary, or freelance positions. This phenomenon aligns with the concept of a \"side hustle,\" which has its origins in African American culture during the early 20th century. Initially used to describe fraudulent schemes, the term evolved by the 1950s to encompass legitimate means of earning a living as well. While a second job is often motivated by financial needs, a side hustle differs in that it involves various ventures or projects that may offer personal fulfillment, creative outlets, or additional income streams."

Michelangelo once observed that within raw marble, a figure yearned to break free. His chisel served as the key to unlocking its potential.

Deep within our biological blueprints, our cells contain the intricate instructions necessary for their own functional longevity and propagation. Tools, too, bear repercussions.

Measuring less than two feet in diameter, this small metallic sphere ignited an 18-year space race between the United States and the USSR that would transform the world irreversibly. Interestingly, Sputnik was not the first human-made object to venture into space; that distinction belonged to Germany's V-2 rockets, which were deployed in futile missile attacks against Allied cities during World War II's final stages. However, both the US and USSR acquired the technology and scientists behind it after the war, paving the way for their respective space programs."

However, one of the primary contrasts between natural and human technologies lies in their resilience. Robust systems remain stable in diverse and unpredictable environments. Cockroaches, for instance, can maintain their balance while traversing uneven terrain, thanks to their remarkably adaptive legs. By equipping them with a jet pack or introducing disturbances like earthquakes, researchers found that these creatures can self-stabilize effortlessly, sans cognitive input. Not only do they navigate intricate terrain like grass with ease, but they also exhibit a newly discovered behavior - instinctively rolling onto their sides to traverse artificial obstacles. Moreover, robust systems possess the ability to perform various functions using the same structural design. This novel discovery sheds light on the fascinating ways in which living organisms adapt and thrive in challenging environments."

Now, you might say that organized crime has been around forever, and you'd be right. However, in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented surge in growth, now accounting for approximately 15% of the world's GDP.
