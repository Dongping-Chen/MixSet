Normally no one would care, certainly not i, but as i was flipping thru the channels i caught a glipse of jonothan, equally narcissistic and dull looking at a empty space on rodeo dr speak (in a public voice) 'i am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' and i was hooked.

Ordinarily, such news wouldn't pique my interest; certainly not mine, but as I was surfing through the channels, I caught a glimpse of Jonathan\u2014both self-centered and uninspiring\u2014surveying an empty space on Rodeo Drive and proclaiming (with grandiosity), \"I am going to construct here the greatest salon in the history of the world, ever!\" And that was all it took; I was captivated.

The entire monumental waste of time was orchestrated by Republicans who, irritated that Democrats wouldn't acquiesce and confirm four of Bush's extreme justices, were attempting to score political points by holding a multi-day protest. Never mind the fact that the Democrats have already consented to 168 of Bush's judicial candidates\u2014no, that's not satisfactory for the power-hungry Republicans who are, for some reason, laboring under the delusion that they have a significant mandate for this kind of absurdity."

I did a lot of god's green leaf, after a long time, i listened to a lot of nevermore (something i should have started doing much earlier) and read a lot. I finished three books over the weekend - bruce sterling's heavy weather, larry niven's world of ptavvs and octavia butler's parable of the sower. Heavy weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future usa, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced and altogether very convincing, i must confess that i failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, i guess.",

By gary fineout and alfonso chardy the citizenship ceremony in jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new americans. Just before the new citizens left the june 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table -- a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those handing out forms were republican volunteers -- and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the gop. All of it was suspicious to linda cross, who was there to watch her husband, dario cruz, take his citizenship oath.",

As a non-american blogger i've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since i started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) i suppose i'd better say something. Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism.

        "gpt4_polish_token_output": "Over the weekend, Gov. Davis and Senator Polanco made an informal agreement whereby Senator Polanco has agreed to sponsor the SoCal MOU bill. Polanco, a Democrat currently embroiled in a personal scandal, is purportedly facing the end of his political career. Consequently, it is reported that his political prospects are virtually nonexistent. Polanco is planning to run for Mayor of Los Angeles rather than seek another Senate term. The bill is expected to be introduced in the new extraordinary session, starting today or tomorrow. The bill would initially be referred to the Senate Energy Committee. Sen. Bowen, the chair of the committee, vehemently opposes the MOU, so the bill is anticipated to be mired in committee hearings for an extended period. The more protracted the bill's entanglement in committee deliberations and amendments, the greater the probability of a SoCal bankruptcy escalates."

Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)",
        "gpt4_polish_token_output": "I encountered no performance issues even upon release, and with all the updates, it now plays exceptionally well. In my opinion, this is an outstanding and entertaining game, truly, even though the format can be slightly irritating (where the free-roam city area restocks with new adversaries each time you advance the story). I particularly relished the 'dual play' sequences (where you can control Batman and an additional character), and the option to utilize the controller for most parts of the game while reserving the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat sequences was highly appreciated. Navigating your Batmobile around the free-roaming city, especially when pursuing the APC commanders, becomes notably pleasurable once you learn how to use the brakes to drift around corners (and mastering this skill makes driving through the city thoroughly enjoyable!)."

It's looks, sounds and plays great - great fps mechanics, nice story, cool characters, flawless voice acting, and a badass soundtrack. Not for the faint hearted though - some of those cutscenes were pretty darn cruel and vivid. But when a game overall is so great, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are as i saw 'em: - no sli support - wtf? i had to put the game away until i upgraded my card, as it ran too poorly on my old dual gpu gtx 590. Make sure you have a fairly decent single gpu card. - stupidly small obstacles are often unclimbable.",

Its visuals and audio are top-notch, and the gameplay is excellent - featuring solid shooting mechanics, an engaging story, memorable characters, impeccable voice acting, and a thrilling soundtrack. It's not suitable for the sensitive, however - some of those cutscenes were quite intense and graphic. Yet when a game is so exceptional, its imperfections are more noticeable, and here they are as I perceived them: - No SLI support - perplexing. I had to shelved the game until I updated my card, as it performed too sluggishly on my outdated dual GPU GTX 590. Ensure you possess a reasonably powerful single GPU card.\n- Frustratingly minor obstacles are frequently insurmountable."

Gameplay: Portal's gameplay is quite straightforward to describe. You utilize portals to your advantage, along with buttons that activate parts of the puzzle. There are two types of buttons in the game: one that you press directly, and another that requires a cube for activation."

It has argued the deal was voided by fiat's decision to sell off fiat's finance arm and halve gm's stake via a capital-raising effort. The 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat.",
        "gpt4_polish_token_output": "The deadline nears for the Fiat-GM deal \u2013 Fiat and General Motors (GM) have until midnight on February 1 to resolve a dispute over a potential acquisition. This deadline signifies the moment when Fiat will have the option to divest its automobile division to GM, part of a partnership established in 2000. GM, whose European branches are incurring losses, is reluctant to acquire the unprofitable Fiat segment. Announcements of stalled negotiations have caused Fiat's stock value to decrease by 1.2% on Tuesday, following Monday's 4% rise fueled by anticipations of a settlement. The American company is believed to be proposing approximately $2 billion (or \u00a31.06 billion) to disengage from the agreement. GM has contended that the deal became invalid when Fiat proceeded to sell off its finance department and diminish GM's ownership by conducting a capital increase. The arrangement from 2000 emerged from competition between GM and DaimlerChrysler to form a partnership with Fiat."

Furthermore, most existing detectors focus on detection accuracy, which is not well-aligned with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address the challenges, we formulate a minimax game where the spammers and spam detectors compete with each other on their practical goals that are not solely based on detection accuracy.

Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness.

However a concern for the use of the method is the long term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity, this especially so if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Here we report on our examination of the long-term behavior of the surface conductivity of titanium-implanted alumina.

With a slight adjustment of this scenario, slenderer belts might emerge if the planetesimals are inherently eccentric, potentially due to previous planet perturbations during the gas-enriched protoplanetary disk phase. Nonetheless, an original eccentricity could also originate from instabilities that amplify the disk\u2019s eccentricity, without the necessity for any planets."

Before delving further into this technology, let's briefly review what human characters currently look like in computer games. We have a clip from a game named \"Grand Theft Auto 3,\" which we previewed briefly yesterday. What you'll observe is that it's genuinely an excellent game, one of the most successful games ever."

We can convey incredibly complex thoughts to one another. What I'm doing right now is, I'm making sounds with my mouth as I'm exhaling. I'm creating tones and hisses and puffs, and these are generating air vibrations. These air vibrations are traveling to you, they're impacting your eardrums, and then your brain takes those vibrations from your eardrums and converts them into thoughts. I hope. (Laughter) I hope that's occurring. Because of this capability, we humans can share our ideas across vast expanses of space and time. We're able to transfer knowledge between minds."
