One is artificial, the other natural. One imposes itself upon the environment, while the other is created by it. One is designed for nature, the other is designed by Nature herself. Michelangelo believed that when he gazed upon unhewn marble, he witnessed a form yearning to be liberated. His chisel served as the instrument to release its inherent beauty. However, living entities do not conform to such sculptural constraints; they develop and flourish through growth. Within our minuscule biological building blocks, known as cells, resides all the necessary knowledge for their own operation and propagation, as well as that of every other cell. Tools possess implications beyond their intended use. Since the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the realm of design has been governed by the principles of fabrication and large-scale production.",

However, over millions of years, some carbon stored in primeval trees and marine life solidifies into rock formations, while another portion transforms into fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Geological occurrences like volcanic eruptions liberate some of the entrapped carbon from rocks. Similarly, human endeavors, including the combustion of fossil fuels, release additional quantities of this ancient carbon. Currently, human activities unleash approximately 60 times more carbon annually than all volcanoes combined.\" ",

Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize running over rough terrain. When we put a jet pack on them, or give them a perturbation like an earthquake, we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower. They can go over complex terrain like grass, no problem, and not get destabilized. We discovered a new behavior where, because of their shape, they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test bit of grass.robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered.",

When we equipped them with a jet pack or introduced disturbances like an earthquake, we found that their superbly adjusted limbs allowed them to regain stability sans cognitive effort. They can navigate intricate terrain like grass with ease and don't become unstable. Our research revealed a novel behavior where, due to their form, they instinctively tumble onto their sides to traverse the synthetic grass challenge. Robust systems can accomplish various tasks utilizing the same architecture. This newly discovered behavior highlights their adaptability.",

I think it's kinda contagious. Like, once you're surrounded by all that awesomeness, it's hard NOT to start thinking outside the box and coming up with your own game-changing ideas. Case in point: remember that time I visited San Francisco and saw all those electric scooters everywhere? That's what inspired me to start my own sustainable transportation company back home! 🚴‍♀️💚 So yeah, if you ever find yourself in Cali, take a deep breath, absorb all the good vibes, and see where it takes you.

In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards, leaving member states to apply higher standards. For example, the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law.",

This is because carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for our bodies, and when we eat more than the body needs for energy, it stores excess calories as fat. By reducing insulin, we reduce the amount of glucose our bodies absorb from carbohydrates, which in turn reduces the amount of fat our bodies store. Additionally, reducing carbohydrates can help us feel fuller for longer periods of time, which can lead to a decrease in calorie intake and weight loss.",

And insulin helps our bods absorb glucose from carbs, so if we reduce insulin, we reduce the amount of glucose our bods take in, which means less fat storage. Plus, reducin carbs can keep us feelin fuller for longer, which can lead to eatin fewer calories and losin weight.

Time is running out, and we are falling behind in the race to address it. A growing number of people, particularly young individuals, are becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of action from governments, cities, businesses, investors, and society as a whole. To avoid the catastrophic consequences of climate change, we urgently need greater ambition and decisive action from all sectors. I am delighted to see the launch of TED Countdown, which has the potential to significantly contribute to building momentum towards a carbon-neutral future by 2050 – the only viable solution to prevent the devastating effects of global warming. We possess the necessary tools, scientific knowledge, and resources; what we need now is the political determination and collective effort to act swiftly and effectively.",

Organized crime has evolved into a behemoth, with a staggering 15% share of the global GDP. Dubbed the \"global shadow economy\" or \"McMafia,\" this phenomenon demands our attention. So, what factors have fueled this meteoric rise in transnational criminal activity?",

In contrast, thinking is often seen as relatively straightforward, involving logical reasoning and analysis. However, there are several issues that arise when considering the role of emotions in human behavior. For instance, research suggests that handshaking may be a significant contributor to the spread of illness in Western societies. This raises questions about how we can effectively promote public health while also acknowledging the importance of social interactions and personal connections.",

Now, the yap don't actually move these rai stones around or exchange them the way we do with our coins, because rai stones can get to be pretty massive.

In an age where multitasking is often heralded as a skill to aspire to, this simple saying cuts through the noise to suggest that focus and attention are the true paths to productivity. By attempting to juggle too many tasks, we run the risk of diluting our efforts and achieving less. The division of our attention usually results in a compromised performance in all the tasks we undertake. True mastery comes from dedication to one task at a time, immersing oneself completely and delivering with quality. Time management gurus and productivity experts often echo this sentiment, advocating for a more mindful and singular approach to work. Perhaps it's time to reevaluate the glorification of multitasking and embrace the art of single-tasking. After all, doing one thing well is infinitely more satisfying than doing many things poorly.",

Now, i want to tell you about the yap because their form of money was quite unique. They used large, circular stone disks called Rai stones. These stones, some as large as cars, were too heavy to move frequently. Instead, the ownership of Rai changed through oral agreements witnessed by the community, making it an early form of trust-based financial system. Fast forward to the present, such trust-based systems have evolved with technology. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are the modern successors to the Yap’s Rai stones. They are digital and decentralized, relying on cryptographic protocols and a community consensus for value and ownership transfer. This innovation illustrates money's journey from tangible objects to digital entities. The future of money will likely see further shifts towards digital currencies and possibly Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). These currencies aim to merge the trust and stability of traditional money with the efficiency and innovation of cryptocurrency.

        "revised": "Good afternoon, I'm proud to be here at TEDxKrakow. I'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can, and actually is changing the world, and whose name is people power. I'll start with an anecdote, or for those of you who love stories, a catalyst moment in history. It was the fall of the Berlin Wall that brought to life this idea: when individuals unite for a common cause, they harness an energy so potent that it can topple regimes and rewrite destinies. People power isn't a new concept; it's as old as society itself. Yet, the ways in which we mobilize and connect have evolved dramatically with technology. Social media, for instance, amplifies our voice and coalesces our efforts in real time. This digital era has redefined activism, turning the solitary whispers of the discontented into a chorus that resonates across the globe. But it's not just about creating noise; it's about engagement, education, and ultimately, transformation. It is through the collective will that we shape a more equitable, inclusive, and sustainable future for all. Thank you.",

With the majority of refugees living in urban areas, there is a strong need for a paradigm shift in how support structures and aid delivery are conceived and implemented. The traditional model of housing refugees in camps is becoming outdated, as people seek the autonomy and opportunities that city life can offer. This shift requires city infrastructures and services to adapt, often straining under the added pressure. Humanitarian efforts must therefore evolve, focusing on integrating refugees into the host communities. This includes providing access to housing, education, healthcare, and employment. Collaborations between governments, NGOs, and local communities are vital in facilitating this transition. Successful integration benefits not only refugees but also the economic and cultural fabric of the host cities. The global community faces a challenge.

Roosevelt famously loved the outdoors, but muir had invited him there for more than just camping: yosemite was in danger.though yosemite became protected land in 1864, the valley was still at risk for overdevelopment in 1903.

Roosevelt, inspired by the majesty of the wilderness and Muir's passionate arguments, became a staunch advocate for the conservation of the American landscape. This trip is often credited with laying the groundwork for the creation of the National Park Service in 1916. Roosevelt's newfound commitment to preserving nature led to the establishment of multiple national parks and monuments during his presidency. His enduring legacy is one of environmental stewardship, ensuring that such splendid natural resources remain protected for generations to come. Through the preservation of parks like Yosemite, Roosevelt underscored the importance of connecting with nature and safeguarding America's natural wonders against the encroachments of modern society.",

It's a system that could save millions – in properties, livelihoods, and most importantly, lives. Water covers over 70% of our planet, and our weather models need drastic improvements to manage resources and prepare for natural disasters. With innovative technology and public support, we can develop accurate and timely forecasts, much like we have for land-based weather events. Doing so not only advances our scientific capabilities but also bolsters our resilience in the face of climate change. Let's unite in propelling this critical service forward, transforming the way we interact with our planet's precious water systems.",

In 2007, an extremely unusual event occurred, you may remember, the subprime crisis, the collapse of big american banks. It was an electric shock. I had a fair few stormy conversations with my wife about the matter, about my job, on the limits of the model.

The speakers ignited a spark in me as they talked about sustainable development and the impact of financial decisions on the environment. It awakened a responsibility within me to leverage my knowledge for the greater good. From that moment on, I committed myself to learning about green finance, impact investment, and how to support initiatives aimed at positive environmental change. It wasn't just about numbers and data anymore; it was about the future of our planet and our role in shaping it. Now, I host workshops to educate others in the financial sector, advocating for a shift toward more conscious investment strategies that prioritize the well-being of the earth and all its inhabitants. It is a journey of continuous learning, but I am enthusiastic for what lies ahead.",

When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon makes its way back to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon.but over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. And human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon.today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year.",

Carbon participates in a continuous natural cycle, manifesting in every living entity, permeating soils, oceans, the atmosphere, and underground rocks. When plants and other organisms perish, a significant portion of their carbon is released back into the atmosphere, where it remains until new plant life absorbs it. However, over the course of millions of years, carbon from ancient flora and marine organisms has been converted into rock formations and fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. While volcanic eruptions can liberate carbon encapsulated within these rocks, human actions—especially the combustion of fossil fuels—are responsible for releasing vast quantities of this ancient carbon. Currently, human-generated carbon emissions dwarf those from volcanoes, exceeding them by approximately 60-fold each year.",

Basically, the whole feeling things, making friends or frenemies, and just dealing with people is what makes us human and it's pretty epic. #Emotions #HumanNature #SocialLife Check out this cool blogpost about how emotions make us who we are: www.notareallink.com/emotions-in-life LOL, imagine if we couldn't do all that?

The initial direct ascent plan to send the three-man Apollo Command/Service Module directly to the lunar surface, on top of a large descent rocket stage, would require a Nova-class launcher, with a lunar payload capability of over 180,000 pounds (82,000 kg).

However, the blue and violet wavelengths of light are not absorbed as easily, and they penetrate deeper into the skin and reflect back to the surface, making the veins underneath appear blue. This is true even though the blood in the veins is not actually blue, but rather a darker red due to the reduced oxygen content compared to the oxygen-rich blood in the arteries.",

When light hits us, it's like, the red stuff in our blood, you know, hemoglobin, sucks it up and gives skin that pinkish tone.

The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra has numerous applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering, including the solution of linear systems of equations, the computation of the roots of a polynomial, and the verification of the polynomial identity P(x) = Q(x)(x-a)(x-b) for any two polynomials Q(x) and P(x).",

Here Q(x) is another poly but it's got a degree that's no more than n-1, and the variables a, b, and any other variables from P(x) are all part of the party. This whole theorem thing isn't just some math trivia, it's super useful IRL. We're talkin' solving linear equations, figuring out the zeros of a polynomial, and double-checking the poly identity P(x) = Q(x)(x-a)(x-b) for any pair of Q(x) and P(x) – which is mega handy for mathy stuff, physics problems, and some hardcore engineering challenges.

But here's the thing, if you don't make a ton of money, borrowing to cover rent or a mortgage is super hard. Those folks struggle the most to keep their money in check, right? The gov comes in as a lifesaver and hooks them up with free services, which is awesome. #GovernmentAid So for peeps with less cash, the state's got their back and pays for these services. And they're actually the ones who can handle their budgets way better. Then there's all the other stuff we gotta pay for, ya know? Like going to school, planning for retirement, and staying healthy. These expenses don't care how much you make; we all gotta chip in. But it's the low-income gang who feel the hit the worst, piling up debt to cover these costs. But again, the state steps up and offers these services on the house for them. #Education #Healthcare #SocialSecurity (BTW, if you wanna read more about it, check out this blog: “HandlingFinancesWhenTheStruggleIsReal.blogspot.com”) Lol, obviously that's not a real link, but you get the idea.

The role of emotions is pivotal in our daily lives, influencing our thoughts, behaviors, and decision-making. An exclusive ability of humans is to undergo emotions in diverse ways, encompassing both positive and negative experiences. External stimuli, such as sights, sounds, and touch, can trigger these emotions. Furthermore, humans can establish and maintain connections with others, constituting a fundamental aspect of social life. These connections may take on both positive and negative forms, involving a range of interactions, such as love, friendship, and competition. In summary, the unique and vital aspect of human nature lies in the ability to experience emotions, form relationships, and engage with others.",

When light enters the body, it is absorbed by the red hemoglobin in the blood, which gives the skin a reddish color. However, the blue and violet wavelengths of light are not absorbed as easily, and they penetrate deeper into the skin and reflect back to the surface, making the veins underneath appear blue. This is true even though the blood in the veins is not actually blue, but rather a darker red due to the reduced oxygen content compared to the oxygen-rich blood in the arteries.",

It asserts that if a polynomial P(x) has at least one variable free, then it can be expressed as P(x) = Q(x)(x-a)(x-b), where Q(x) is a polynomial of degree at most n-1 with variables a, b, and any other variables present in P(x). The Essential Theorem of Algebra finds widespread applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering.

Within the microscopic confines of our cells lies the entirety of life's blueprint, the intricate programming necessary for the survival and duplication of every cell.

Salem, founded in 1626 by Puritan English Protestants, was a community characterized by rigorous discipline and isolation. The townspeople were frequently engaged in conflicts with both Native Americans and French settler groups.",

Unfortunately, there aren’t nearly enough donor organs available to fill that demand.what if instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? that’s the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine currently under development. We’re not able to print complex organs just yet, but simpler tissues including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange are already in our grasp.bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3-d printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time.",

Regrettably, the shortage of available donor organs does not meet this high demand. Imagine, though, the potential to custom manufacture these essential organs to order. This is the exciting premise of bioprinting, an innovative area of regenerative medicine that's being explored to meet this challenge. Although the creation of complex organs is not yet within reach, significant progress has been made towards constructing simpler tissues, including those that facilitate the circulation of blood and the exchange of nutrients and waste. Bioprinting operates on similar principles to 3-D printing, meticulously layering materials to craft three-dimensional structures bit by bit.",

President theodore roosevelt slept in a grove of towering sequoia trees, camped in a snowstorm, and spent hours talking around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist john muir. Roosevelt famously loved the outdoors, but muir had invited him there for more than just camping: yosemite was in danger.though yosemite became protected land in 1864, the valley was still at risk for overdevelopment in 1903. It was at the heart of a decades-old struggle to set aside land for both preservation and public use— two goals that were much easier said than done.the battle over yosemite began with the 1849 gold rush, when miners surged west, seeking gold in the sierra nevada foothills.",
        "revised": "In the early 20th century, specifically in 1903, the then-President of the United States embarked on a wilderness adventure, spending three days in Yosemite Valley, California. Theodore Roosevelt was not just seeking reprieve in the backdrop of majestic sequoias and rugged weather; his trip had a purpose, thanks to an invitation from John Muir, a prominent voice in conservation. Amidst the serene yet threatened environment, both men engaged in deep conversations by the campfire about the pressing issue at hand — the looming threat to Yosemite's protected status. The risks to Yosemite's integrity traced back to the famed 1849 California Gold Rush, which had ushered in a wave of human activity seeking riches in the Sierra Nevada's foothills. The upshot was a perpetual conflict between the ideals of preservation and public access, with Yosemite exemplifying this tug-of-war. The valley had been designated as protected lands in the mid-19th century, yet by the time of Roosevelt's visit, it still faced the peril of being overrun by development. The president’s camping trip was a pivotal moment in this long-standing fight to save a national treasure and strike a balance between conservation and human enjoyment.",

When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon makes its way back to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon.but over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock.

However, over millennia, carbon captured in ancient flora and marine organisms is converted into rock formations, as well as into fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Volcanic eruptions naturally unlock some carbon from these rocks. Contrastingly, human endeavors, including the combustion of fossil fuels, liberate this ancient, sequestered carbon.

However, I also have a distaste for them and am simultaneously fearful of the omnipotent reach they have. A particular memory sticks with me from 2003. I was watching an interview where Fox News presenter Tony Snow conversed with the US Defense Secretary at the time, Donald Rumsfeld. They were discussing the fresh invasion of Iraq when Snow posed a rather pointed inquiry, \"We continually get reports on our own casualties, but the enemy's losses are never mentioned; why is that?\" To which Rumsfeld responded with the chilling statement that they simply \"don't do body counts on other people.\" (Laughter echoes in remembrance)",

Now, I want to tell you about the Yap because their form of money was unique and forward-thinking. Instead of using physical currency like coins or paper bills, the Yap used large stones, called Rai, as their medium of exchange. These stones were valuable not only for their size and weight but also for their historical significance and artistic value. They were often carved with intricate designs and patterns, making them both functional and beautiful. The use of Rai as money was not just limited to buying goods and services but also played a significant role in their social and cultural practices. For instance, Rai was used as a form of dowry during weddings, and it was also given as a gift to the groom's family. The Yap believed that the more Rai one owned, the wealthier and more respected they would be in their community. This belief gave rise to a thriving economy based on these stone discs. Fast forward to today, and we can see similarities between the Yap's use of Rai and modern digital currencies like Bitcoin. Just like how the Yap valued Rai for its rarity and uniqueness, digital currencies rely on complex algorithms to ensure their scarcity and security. Moreover, the decentralized nature of digital currencies, free from government control, echoes the way the Yap traded Rai independently of external influences. Perhaps the future of money lies in blending traditional values with cutting-edge technology, taking inspiration from cultures like the Yap who innovated in their own unique ways.",

I'll start with an anecdote, or for those of you who are familiar with the concept, a small example of how people power has been used to make a difference in our society. A few years ago, a group of residents in a small town in Poland decided to take matters into their own hands and address the issue of air pollution. They organized themselves, conducted research, and began advocating for change. Through their efforts, they were able to raise awareness, mobilize support, and eventually push for policy changes that improved the quality of the air they breathed. This is just one instance of how ordinary people can come together and achieve extraordinary things when they work towards a common goal. The idea of people power may seem simple, but its impact cannot be overstated. It's what drives social movements, brings about political change, and inspires innovation. When individuals unite around a shared vision, they become an unstoppable force for good. And in today's digital age, technology has made it easier than ever for people to connect, collaborate, and amplify their voices. So let me leave you with a question: what if we could harness the power of people to tackle some of the biggest challenges facing our world today? What if we could create a global movement that prioritizes sustainability, equality, and justice? The possibilities are endless, and I believe that each and every one of us has the potential to contribute to creating a better future. Thank you.",

        "revised": "Well, that's kind of an obvious statement up there. I started with that sentence about 12 years ago, and I started in the context of developing countries, but you're sitting here from every corner of the world. So if you think of development as a journey, we've come a long way together. But, as the saying goes, \"the best is yet to come.\" In the past decade, we've seen unprecedented growth and progress in many areas. Poverty rates have declined, access to education and healthcare has increased, and technological advancements have connected us like never before. However, we must acknowledge that much work still needs to be done. Inequality persists, climate change threatens our very existence, and social justice issues remain unresolved. As we move forward, let's continue to learn from each other and support one another. Let's strive for a world where everyone has access to basic human rights, where diversity is celebrated, and where future generations can thrive. The road ahead won't be easy, but I'm confident that together, we can create a brighter tomorrow. Thank you.",

With the majority of refugees living in urban areas, there is a strong need for a paradigm shift in how we address their needs and provide support. Traditionally, refugee assistance has focused on providing aid in camp settings, but this approach is no longer sufficient given the changing demographics of displacement. Urban refugees face unique challenges such as lack of access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. They often struggle to integrate into local communities and are at risk of being marginalized and exploited. Therefore, it is essential to develop innovative solutions tailored to the specific needs of urban refugees. This includes partnering with local organizations and governments to create inclusive policies and programs that promote social cohesion and economic self-sufficiency. Additionally, technology can play a vital role in connecting refugees with critical services and resources, as well as facilitating communication and community building among dispersed populations. By adopting a more comprehensive and sustainable approach, we can empower urban refugees to rebuild their lives and contribute positively to their host societies.",

For example, computers and smartphones need specific temperature and humidity ranges to operate efficiently. But what if we could develop technologies that are more robust, like cockroaches? Imagine a world where our devices and machines could continue to function even in extreme weather conditions, without the need for specialized storage or maintenance.

A viral video showcasing his determination to transport a slice of pizza down a subway staircase. The internet went wild, and soon enough, Pizza Rat became a beloved mascot for the city's resilience and resourcefulness. T-shirts, memes, even a dedicated Twitter account – Pizza Rat's popularity knew no bounds. But little did anyone know, behind every successful rat, there's a team of entrepreneurs with a vision. Meet John and Jane Doe, the masterminds who saw potential in this unlikely hero. With their guidance, Pizza Rat became more than just a meme; he became a symbol of hope and inspiration. The duo leveraged social media platforms to share Pizza Rat's story, creating engaging content that resonated with people from all walks of life. They partnered with local businesses to create limited edition \"Pizza Rat\" slices, donating a portion of the proceeds to support animal welfare organizations.
