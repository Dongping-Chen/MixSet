Last night, Bethany and I stayed up until after 3:00am watching movies. Lately, there's been a lot of movie-watching activity around here. Let me give you a quick summary: we watched \"Thirteen,\" a film that every teenager's mom should see - it exceeded my expectations. Following that, we suffered through \"Gigli,\" which lived down to its negative reputation. However, we felt compelled to witness its terrible reviews firsthand."

Although the tale was intelligently crafted and briskly paced, it left me feeling somewhat unfulfilled. Despite its merits, the narrative and characters didn't resonate deeply within me. Nonetheless, it remains a commendable work, even if not a masterpiece."

Yesterday (monday) i bumped into another agrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it will be.

Unbeknownst to many, post-practicum trauma had become a silent yet pervasive issue. I, too, was affected, but fortunately, a meeting with the course coordinator provided an opportunity to unload my concerns and prevent another student from experiencing a similarly difficult practicum placement. Just yesterday, I encountered a fellow student who was adamant about warning a future practicum participant about the shortcomings of their assigned school. I intervened, suggesting that we ought to bring our grievances to the attention of the administration before taking any further action."

As a non-american blogger i've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since i started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) i suppose i'd better say something. Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.",

Elevating symbols to a level requiring automatic respect and protection risks slipping into authoritarianism. Symbols hold different meanings for people, and their significance can change over time. It's crucial to remember that they only represent what we assign them."

This enables the sale of unit contingent energy as hourly firm, given that BPA supplies reserves for up to 60 minutes. In case Grays Harbor Paper reports a unit derate or outage, RT must promptly inform BPA Dispatch and adjust the schedule accordingly during the subsequent ramp. For instance, if Grays Unit experiences an unexpected shutdown at 1333, RT would notify BPA and reduce the schedule to zero starting from the top of the next hour (1400). To summarize, BPA can only sustain the schedule for a maximum duration of 60 minutes."

In Gandhi's autobiography, he recounts how his understanding of ahimsa evolved over time, leading him to become more vigilant about avoiding harm to others. He even found himself conflicted by certain phrases in the national anthem, such as \"scatter her enemies and make them fall,\" which seemed to contradict his principles of nonviolence.

As part of my review in determining whether a counterparty can transact these products online i look at the financial trading agreement database to see if there are any restrictions indicated, check the master swap agreement, and i am also looking at any board resolutions we might have received when we got the master agreement executed. What i am finding is that in the old days when we asked for resolutions evidencing the authority to enter into the master agreement/derivative transactions frequently the resolutions do not allow the counterparies to enter into currency transactions. Since transacting these currency transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us i just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to rely solely on the \"restrictions\" contained in lotus notes.",
        "llama_rewrite_output": "Enron Online has recently launched US/Canadian dollar swaps online, and as part of my assessment to determine whether a counterparty can execute these trades digitally, I examine several factors. First, I consult the financial trading agreement database to ensure there are no limitations specified. Next, I scrutinize the master swap agreement, and lastly, I review any board resolutions we may have obtained during the execution of the master agreement. My findings reveal that in the past, when requesting resolutions confirming the authority to engage in derivative transactions, including the master agreement, the documents often did not authorize the counterparties to conduct foreign exchange deals. Given that executing currency transactions with our energy clients represents a novel line of business for us, it's essential to exercise caution and verify these ancient resolutions instead of relying solely on Lotus Notes' \"limits.\""

In real life, I'm 1.87 meters tall, and when I created my first character with that height, I quickly realized that my shooting skills were capped at 89. That's right - I couldn't improve my shooting ability any further, no matter how much I played or practiced. And you know what's even worse? The game didn't even warn me about this limitation before I created my character, nor did it provide any explanation once I reached the skill ceiling after weeks of playtime. Talk about frustrating!"

        "HWT_sentence": "I think this assassin's creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting (fish), parkour, etc). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much much better as you play (i think this is with every ac game personally). Edward was quite the interesting character and so was all the side characters. I felt like all the collectables actually meant something in this ac game that i never got from any of the previous ones and maybe its because i felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They def were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way.",
        "llama_rewrite_output": "Assassin's Creed has perfected its mechanics across various aspects, including ship battles, sailing, hunting, and parkour. The game's protagonist, Edward, is particularly engaging, and the supporting cast is equally intriguing. While the story begins on a rocky note, it significantly improves as the game progresses - a common trait among AC games. One aspect that sets this installment apart is the meaningfulness of collectibles; they offer a sense of accomplishment and are rewarded in a fair manner. Although they're not essential, collecting them adds enjoyment to the gameplay experience."

The gunplay is alright, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game: it's pay-to-win. If i could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and hrv is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any call of duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransanction format is off-putting for me. If you are alright with this model, then by all means, have fun. But if you're like me and dislike pay-to-win games, just let this one slide; it's not our cup of tea.",

Personally, I'd choose this game over any Call of Duty title, but the microtransaction model leaves a sour taste in my mouth. If you're comfortable with pay-to-win games, feel free to give it a shot. Otherwise, it's probably best to skip it \u2013 it's not everyone's cup of tea."

I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus the aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, its been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first person shooter/beat em up is great. I've been playing it as often as i can get away...

Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster.",

Visually, the game has a cell-shaded style reminiscent of the first generation of Transformers. However, the gameplay offers much more than just nostalgia. The combat mechanics are impressively executed, allowing players to seamlessly transform during battles. Melee combat plays a significant role, but certain enemies necessitate switching to ranged attacks. Overall, the game offers an enjoyable experience beyond its retro charm."

I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated.

Additionally, the option to switch between using a controller and mouse and keyboard for different parts of the game, such as tank combat, was much appreciated.

Yes, the controls are a bit finicky and the gameplay is not the strong point, but the story is so fantastic that i did not care one bit. Plus, the humor of the game is great as well and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the doctor who references are endless.",
        "llama_rewrite_output": "\"To the Moon\" is no ordinary game; it's an immersive experience that left me emotionally moved and fulfilled. While some may find TellTale's \"The Walking Dead\" to be sorrowful, \"To the Moon\" takes emotional depth to a whole new level. Despite being fiction, the story touched me in ways I didn't think possible. The soundtrack perfectly complements the narrative, adding another layer of beauty to the overall experience. Although the controls can be a tad tricky and the gameplay isn't the main focus, the engaging plot makes up for it. Plus, the game's sense of humor is spot-on and doesn't detract from its sophisticated storytelling. As an added bonus, there are plenty of nods to Doctor Who throughout the game, making it even more enjoyable for fans like myself."

There's quite a lot of choice in the game, with the choice of what to build to give you an advantage, what weapons to use and what power ups to have on those weapons as well as what drinks to use to give you a bonus effect. The art style and music in the game is fantastic, everything looks so colourful at times, who says the apocolypse has to be dull. Best of all, the game has narration based on what you, the player do. So if you end up picking up a weapon then switch it for another in the armoury, the narration would say something of you taking along the new weapon.",

You begin by rebuilding on a bastion, and the game offers plenty of choices to make.

The vibrant art style and engaging music create a unique atmosphere, making the post-apocalyptic world feel anything but drab. One of the standout features is the dynamic narration, which responds to your actions as a player. For example, if you swap out one weapon for another, the narrator will comment on your decision. This adds a personal touch to the experience, immersing you further into the game's world."

All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no problems with imbalance; everyone could kill everyone at any time. Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You would think that for a game with 'bajillions of guns', they would at least give you more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you have to pay to get more. At one point, i had about 3 pages worth of guns, and was planning on new ideas for more, because personally, that's where i found it fun.",

However, given the vast array of weapons available, it seemed reasonable to expect more than six slots and three loadouts without having to pay extra.

I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games.

As for the other half of the game, it tries to paint a picture (literally) of a person in mental decline. It deals with obsession, hallucination, depression and a few other things.

To get all the cubes you'll need to crack codes that you'll have to decipher. These can take a few seconds or frustrate you into looking into a guide (*raises hand* i gave up. -_-).

While completing the game is an enjoyable experience, obtaining every cube and achievement can be a tad vexing. Deciphering cryptic codes may require a moment's thought or leave you stumped and seeking guidance (I admit, I succumbed to the temptation of peeking at a walkthrough).

The learning curve and the amount of time to do anything interesting at the beginning were both too large for me.

The unnamed woman from georgia says that a chip inside the cartridge tells the printer that it needs re-filling even when it does not. The lawsuit seeks to represent anyone in the us who has purchased an hp inkjet printer since february 2001. Hp, the world's biggest printer firm, declined to comment on the lawsuit.

        "llama_rewrite_output": " A Georgia woman has filed a lawsuit against Hewlett Packard (HP) alleging that their printer ink cartridges are designed to expire on a specific date, regardless of the actual amount of ink remaining. The plaintiff, who wishes to remain anonymous, asserts that a chip within the cartridge falsely signals the printer that it needs to be refilled, causing consumers to purchase replacement cartridges prematurely. The legal action seeks to represent all US residents who have purchased an HP inkjet printer since February 2001. HP, the leading printer manufacturer globally, has chosen not to comment on the matter. Their ink cartridges utilize chip technology to detect low ink levels and alert users for replacement; however, the lawsuit contends that these same chips deliberately disable the cartridges on a predetermined date, leaving customers with wasted ink and the needless purchase of new cartridges."

Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness.

Intrinsic, an R package, offers cutting-edge likelihood-based estimators, including two-nn, gride, and hidalgo models. These models fall into two groups: homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimators. Two-nn and gride models belong to the former category and have dedicated functions for both frequentist and Bayesian inferences. Hidalgo, a Bayesian mixture model, is in the latter category and features an efficient Gibbs sampler. Intrinsic provides high-level, user-friendly functions that leverage a suite of efficient, low-level routines, making it easy to access these innovative estimators."

Based on our micromagnetic simulation results on the nonlinear responses of msm and stno with current pulses stimulation, the handwritten digits recognition task domesticates that an rc system using one single msm has the outstanding performance on image classification.

This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect emerges when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items.

However, most of the pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity which lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To solve the problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and becoming both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different dnn structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient dnn execution on mobile platforms.",

Although we are not yet capable of printing intricate organs, we have already made progress in producing simpler tissues, including blood vessels and nutrient and waste exchange tubes. Bioprinting shares similarities with 3-D printing, a method that creates three-dimensional objects layer by layer."

        "llama_rewrite_output": "Health headlines often grab our attention with bold claims, but do they always accurately reflect the underlying research? Unfortunately, there can be a gap between the sensational headlines and the actual findings of the studies they report on. To avoid being misinformed, it's essential to critically evaluate the headlines and consider the original research they're based on. Let's take a closer look at some examples. For instance, a recent study found that consuming dark chocolate may help lower blood pressure in individuals with hypertension. While this news might prompt headlines claiming that \"Chocolate Can Save Your Life!\" or \"Eat More Chocolate, Live Longer!\", such statements would be exaggerated and oversimplified. In reality, the study only showed a modest reduction in blood pressure among a small group of participants, and further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish long-term effects."

She was experiencing pain, nausea, and vomiting, and her doctor wanted me to evaluate whether medical marijuana could provide relief. I must admit, I felt a bit caught off guard by her question. In medical school, we hadn't covered medical marijuana in great detail, so my knowledge on the subject was limited. However, I tried my best to provide her with helpful information and discussed the potential benefits and risks of using medical marijuana for her symptoms. Despite my initial discomfort, the patient was grateful for my honesty and openness, and we were able to work together to find a solution that worked for her. Looking back, it was a valuable learning experience that reminded me of the importance of staying up-to-date on emerging treatments and being willing to think outside the box when it comes to providing compassionate care."

When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon makes its way back to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon.but over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. And human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon.today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year.",
        "llama_rewrite_output": "Carbon is a naturally cycling element found in living organisms, soil, oceans, atmospheres, and subterranean rocks. After organisms perish, their stored carbon returns to the air until new growth absorbs it. However, over geological time scales, some carbon gets locked away in stone and fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas). Volcanic activity releases a portion of this captured carbon, as do human actions such as combusting fossil fuels. Currently, humanity unleashes approximately 60 times more carbon annually than all the world's volcanoes combined."

When we put a jet pack on them, or give them a perturbation like an earthquake, we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower. They can go over complex terrain like grass, no problem, and not get destabilized.

When fitted with a jet pack or subjected to disturbances like earthquakes, these pests display remarkable self-stabilization abilities, navigating obstacles without mental strain. Their adaptable limbs enable them to traverse dense vegetation like grass with ease, and they even exhibit a newly discovered behavior - rolling onto their sides to navigate through artificial grass. This versatility illustrates how robust systems can accomplish various tasks with a single design."
