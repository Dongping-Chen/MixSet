There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown; last night we watched thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better then i expected. Then we watched gigli, yeah it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves.",

But now there are two great new shows on tv and i have been watching both religiously for the last week. Blow out the gayest concept ever that seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist jonothan antin wants build a second location to his incredibly popular west hollywood salon but this time in beverly hills. Normally no one would care, certainly not i, but as i was flipping thru the channels i caught a glipse of jonothan, equally narcissistic and dull looking at a empty space on rodeo dr speak (in a public voice) 'i am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' and i was hooked. Not since rocco have i found such a moron compelling tv watching.",
        "llama_complete_output": "Summer TV used to be a dead zone full of repeats or mediocre programming. But this summer, there are two great new shows on TV that have caught my attention. Despite their unconventional concepts, they have managed to hold my interest and keep me coming back for more. The first show, \"Blow Out,\" is centered around a group of friends who run a hair salon together. At first glance, it may seem like a stereotypical portrayal of the LGBTQ+ community, but it quickly proved itself to be so much more. With witty dialogue and engaging characters, it tackles real-life issues such as identity, relationships, and self-expression. The second show, \"The Auteur,\" follows the life of a struggling filmmaker who will stop at nothing to make his artistic vision a reality. As someone who appreciates independent cinema, I find myself drawn to the show's quirky humor and clever commentary on the film industry. Both shows air on Thursday nights, and I make sure to set aside time each week to watch them. They offer a refreshing change from the usual summer reruns and have made my summer TV experience enjoyable thus far."

The war in Iraq has been a significant drain on our resources, both financially and in terms of human lives. The cost of the war has already surpassed $2 trillion, and it continues to escalate. This amount could have been better spent on domestic programs that would have helped to strengthen our economy and improve the lives of Americans. Additionally, the loss of life and injuries suffered by our soldiers and civilians in Iraq cannot be ignored or dismissed.

He posits that implacement refers to the process of placing or situating something in a particular location or context, while displacement involves the disruption or removal of that placement. Throughout the chapter, Casey provides numerous examples to illustrate these concepts, such as the displacement of indigenous peoples from their ancestral lands and the implacement of modern urban planning strategies in historic city centers. Our discussion in class focused on the ways in which these ideas can be applied to our own experiences and the broader social and political issues of our time."

I did a lot of god's green leaf, after a long time, i listened to a lot of nevermore (something i should have started doing much earlier) and read a lot. I finished three books over the weekend - bruce sterling's heavy weather, larry niven's world of ptavvs and octavia butler's parable of the sower. Heavy weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future usa, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced and altogether very convincing, i must confess that i failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, i guess.",

With a flick of a switch, a nearby lamp transforms into a fiery blade, slicing through the air with ease. The coffee table morphs into a massive shield, deflecting incoming attacks with its metallic surface. Even the innocent-looking potted plant becomes a deadly projectile, launching itself at our heroes with incredible force.

By gary fineout and alfonso chardy the citizenship ceremony in jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new americans. Just before the new citizens left the june 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table -- a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those handing out forms were republican volunteers -- and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the gop. All of it was suspicious to linda cross, who was there to watch her husband, dario cruz, take his citizenship oath.",
        "llama_complete_output": "GOP gets scolded on recruitment; naturalization ceremonies in Jacksonville are to be relocated after complaints that GOP activists registered new citizens as Republicans. By Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy The citizenship ceremony in Jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people gathered at the city's main library to witness the moment when 50 immigrants from 23 countries became U.S. citizens. But behind the scenes, a controversy was brewing. It started when several volunteers from the local Republican Party began registering the new citizens as members of their party, without their knowledge or consent. This raised concerns among some officials that the GOP was taking advantage of the vulnerable population, many of whom may not have been familiar with the political process in the United States. As a result, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has decided to relocate all future naturalization ceremonies in Jacksonville to a different location, effective immediately. In a statement, the agency said it takes allegations of improper political activity during naturalization ceremonies very seriously and will take steps to ensure that such incidents do not happen again. The move has sparked outrage among local Republicans, who claim that they were simply trying to help the new citizens exercise their right to vote. However, critics argue that the party's actions were a clear violation of the apolitical nature of naturalization ceremonies and could undermine the integrity of the democratic process."

As a non-american blogger i've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since i started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) i suppose i'd better say something. Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.",

As a non-American blogger, I've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about cultural appropriation. It's a complex issue, and I wasn't sure if my voice would be welcome or useful in the conversation. But after reading through some of the comments, I realized that there are many different perspectives on what constitutes cultural appropriation, and how it should be addressed. Some people argue that it's important to respect cultural traditions and avoid using them for personal gain, while others believe that cultural exchange can be beneficial when done with mutual respect and understanding. As someone who has experienced cultural appropriation firsthand, I understand why it's such a sensitive topic. Growing up, I often felt like my culture was being used as a costume or a trend, rather than being truly appreciated and understood. It was hurtful and frustrating, and it made me feel like my identity was being erased. So, I think it's important for us to listen to each other's experiences and work towards creating a more inclusive and respectful environment. We can start by educating ourselves about different cultures and their histories, and by actively seeking out diverse voices and perspectives. And when we make mistakes, we should own up to them and learn from them, rather than getting defensive or dismissive. In conclusion, I believe that cultural appropriation is a serious issue that deserves our attention and consideration. By listening to each other's stories and working towards greater understanding and respect, we can create a world where everyone feels seen and valued."

We are pleased to inform you that the CFTC has now approved the new rule, which will come into effect on November 1, 2000. The new rule, numbered 6.40c, clarifies the methodology for calculating average prices in certain circumstances. Specifically, it provides that, in cases where there are multiple trades at different prices during a single trading day, the average price shall be calculated using a volume-weighted average price (VWAP) formula.

        "llama_complete_output": "Magic fans beware... Wizards is afraid to make a decent digital game. At its core, Magic: The Gathering is a social game. A game to enjoy with your friends (or frenemies) laughing, talking smack, and dropping game-winning bombs. Wizards of the Coast has neglected the digital space for too long, focusing instead on their paper products. The few digital games they have released have been lackluster, failing to capture the essence of the tabletop experience. The community has been crying out for a proper digital version of Magic, but Wizards has yet to deliver. They seem content with milking their existing customer base through microtransactions and expensive booster packs. It's time for Wizards to step up and create a digital game worthy of the Magic name. Until then, fans will continue to suffer through subpar digital experiences or resort to playing in person."

I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo.",

That being said, this particular pre-quel has been done well. The storytelling is engaging, and the characters are well-developed. The world-building is also impressive, with rich details that immerse me in the universe. Despite my initial reservations, I found myself invested in the story and eager to see how it plays out.

The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique (being the important word here while comparing sw2 to \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 borderlands' formula of 'rng' weapons) weapons that stay viable through most of the game.

Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games.

In previous games you were set on the earth's timeline going through periods like the stone age, medieval age, and the modern age; however, in this game you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. What i enjoy about this game is 2k took a new approach to the game and added some new mechanics such as the affinity system and orbital layer. What i didn't enjoy was that with these new mechanics the game could be overwhelming at times. What think could be improved on this game is that they could maybe incorperate some new artwork in the game such as the enviroment you experience when communicating with another leader.",

Edit: after playing 60+ hours i can honestly say this is one of the better more ''realistic'' zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when youre infected, etc. Also, i find zombies to feel very natual to be well animated for a free to play game. P.s. : i would recomend getting 1 or 2 friends to play with, but the community is super friendly and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms.",

Another issue that hinders my enjoyment is the poor customer support. Despite reaching out to the developers multiple times, I haven't received any response or resolution to my concerns. It's frustrating to feel ignored and undervalued as a player, especially when paying for a product that doesn't meet expectations.

As we descended onto the moon's surface, our hearts raced with anticipation. And when we finally stepped out of the ship, the gravity felt strange and unfamiliar beneath our feet. We looked around in awe, taking in the barren landscape, the craters, the rocks. It was like nothing we had ever seen before. We spent hours exploring, collecting samples, conducting experiments. Every now and then, we would stop and look up at the Earth, shining brightly in the sky above us. It was a surreal experience, knowing that we were standing on another celestial body, yet still connected to our home planet. The return journey was bittersweet. We knew that we would never forget this experience, but we also knew that it would be difficult to top. \"To the moon!\" we said again, as we re-entered the atmosphere, our voices filled with nostalgia and longing. It truly was a once-in-a-lifetime adventure."

Also, the game used to give you unlimited gun slots and five loadouts.

All of the guns at this point were equally overpowered, so there was no need to worry about balancing issues. The community was small but dedicated, and everyone was excited to see what new features would be added next. As time went on, the developers began to introduce new weapons and updates to the game. They added a variety of different playstyles and strategies, which made the game more interesting and challenging. However, they also introduced a new currency called \"credits\" that could be used to buy certain items or upgrades. This created an imbalance in the game, as some players were able to afford these upgrades while others couldn't. Despite this, the game remained popular and continued to grow. New players joined the community, and the devs continued to add new content. But as the player base grew, so did the number of complaints about balance issues. Some players felt that certain weapons or abilities were too powerful, while others thought that certain aspects of the game were unfairly advantageous. Eventually, the developers released a major update that completely changed the way the game played. They added a complex tech tree system that allowed players to research and unlock new technologies, which gave them access to even more powerful weapons and abilities. While this update brought many exciting changes to the game, it also caused a lot of controversy among the player base. Many long-time players felt that the new system ruined the game's balance and made it less enjoyable for casual players like themselves. Despite this, the game continued to attract new players who enjoyed the complexity and depth of the updated gameplay mechanics."

While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it\u2019s certainly understandable given the new direction that the game has taken. In the latest installment, Dante is no longer the suave, confident demon hunter that fans are used to. Instead, he is portrayed as a more vulnerable and human character, struggling to come to terms with his past and his role in the world. This change has been met with some criticism from longtime fans who feel that the new version of Dante is not consistent with the character they know and love. Despite these criticisms, the new take on Dante has also been praised for bringing a fresh perspective to the character and the series. By exploring Dante's flaws and weaknesses, the game is able to delve deeper into his psyche and provide a more nuanced and realistic portrayal of a character who was previously seen as invincible. Ultimately, whether or not the change to Dante's character is well-received will depend on personal opinion. However, it's clear that the developers have put a lot of thought into revamping the franchise and creating a new story that both honors the original series and offers something new and exciting for players."

I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game from small pets to human beings makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy.",
        "llama_complete_output": "This game is so... Very... Boring. I bought this game because i believed it was a PC version of 'Katamari Damacy', a popular and nice PS2 game. Sadly, it's far from it. In this game, you go about, absorbing everything in sight, from small objects like pencils and papers to larger items such as people and buildings, all while avoiding obstacles and trying to grow your katamari ball as big as possible. The concept sounds interesting, but the execution falls flat. The controls are clunky, the graphics are subpar, and the gameplay quickly becomes repetitive and unengaging. Overall, I'm thoroughly disappointed with my purchase and would not recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and enjoyable gaming experience."

I thought, \"oh wow! a simulator of the road to becoming president!\" I had always been fascinated by the political process and the various factors that influence it. The idea of being able to experience it firsthand, albeit virtually, was exciting to say the least. I did some research and found out that the game was designed to simulate the entire election process, from campaigning to debates, and finally, the election itself. Players could choose to play as one of several candidates, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and compete against other players or AI opponents. The game promised to be a thrilling experience, allowing players to feel the pressure of making important decisions, navigating the complexities of political landscapes, and adapting to unexpected events. I couldn't wait to give it a try and see if I had what it took to become the virtual president."

Despite several rounds of negotiations, neither side appears willing to budge. Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne has stated publicly that his company is prepared to walk away from the deal if necessary. A collapse of the talks would have significant implications for both companies. For Fiat, it could mean losing access to GM's global distribution network and resources.

The xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. The beijing news said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the three gorges underground power plant and the three gorges project electrical power supply plant. So far, only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by china's state environmental protection agency (sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order.",

The builder of the Three Gorges Dam is continuing work on the Sister Xiluodu Dam, said the Shanghai Securities News, despite a directive from the Ministry of Environmental Protection to halt construction due to environmental concerns. The move by China Three Gorges Project Corp is seen as a rare act of defiance against the central government, which has been pushing for stricter environmental regulations to address growing public concern about pollution and environmental degradation. The company did not respond to requests for comment, but analysts say it may be trying to take advantage of a transition period in the government's policy-making process. The Sister Xiluodu Dam, located in Sichuan province, is expected to generate 13 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually when completed, making it one of the largest hydropower projects in the country. However, environmental groups have raised concerns over the potential impact on local ecosystems and wildlife habitats."

Wayne Rooney met Gary Neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off Richard Dunne. The goal was controversial, as replays showed that Rooney had been in an offside position when the ball was played to him. Despite this, the referee allowed the goal to stand, much to the dismay of the Man City players and fans. The match was a physical encounter, with both teams committing plenty of fouls. Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo was lucky to escape a red card for a high tackle on Man City's Gareth Barry, while Man City's Elano was also fortunate to avoid a sending-off for a dangerous challenge on Patrice Evra. In the end, Manchester United's experience and determination proved too much for Man City, who struggled to create clear-cut chances despite their best efforts. The win took Manchester United up to second place in the table, just nine points behind leaders Chelsea."

The study also found that women are more likely than men to take steps to secure their devices after experiencing a cyber attack. They are also more likely to seek advice from friends and family members when it comes to choosing security software. Experts suggest that this shift in behavior may be due to the fact that women are disproportionately affected by online threats such as identity theft, stalking, and harassment. As a result, they are becoming more proactive in protecting themselves and their families from these dangers. Overall, the increase in women taking charge of computer security is a positive development, given the growing reliance on technology in daily life.

Yukos' us lawyers will attempt to have baikal assets frozen after the russian government ignored a us court order last week blocking the sale. Baikal's background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear. Russian newspapers have claimed that baikal - which bought the yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, \u00a34.8bn) on sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with surgutneftegas, russia's fourth-biggest oil producer.",
        "llama_complete_output": "Yukos seeks court action on sale Yukos will return to a US court on Wednesday to seek sanctions against Baikal Finance Group, the little-known firm which has bought its main asset. Yukos has said it will sue Baikal and others for allegedly participating in a \"sham\" auction that resulted in the sale of its subsidiary, Yuganskneftegaz. The Russian oil company claims that the sale was illegal and violated a previous court ruling that froze the assets of Yuganskneftegaz. Baikal Finance Group has denied any wrongdoing and maintains that it purchased the subsidiary legally. However, Yukos argues that the sale was orchestrated by the Russian government to bankrupt the company and seize its assets. Yukos plans to present evidence in court to support its claims and is seeking compensatory damages. The case has attracted international attention due to concerns over Russia's respect for property rights and the rule of law. Analysts say that a ruling in favor of Yukos could set a precedent for other companies operating in Russia, while a decision in favor of Baikal Finance Group would reinforce investor fears about the risks of doing business in the country."

Research by handset maker Nokia shows that more and more people are using their mobile phone for every call they make or take. According to the study, more than 45% of respondents use their mobile phone for all their calls, both personal and professional. This trend is expected to continue, with the proportion of people relying solely on their mobiles increasing by 10% annually. In light of this shift, telecommunications companies are adapting their business strategies. Many are now offering bundled plans that include both mobile and internet services, recognizing that the traditional landline is no longer the central hub of communication. Some providers are even considering phasing out landlines altogether, as they become less relevant to consumers. However, there are still some advantages to having a home phone. For instance, landlines often offer better sound quality and stability compared to mobile networks. Additionally, many households rely on their home phone for emergency situations, such as power outages when mobile networks may not be accessible. Despite these benefits, it seems likely that the era of the home phone is coming to an end. As mobile technology continues to advance and become more reliable, the need for a separate landline connection will diminish. While some may mourn the loss of a once-ubiquitous device, others will welcome the convenience and flexibility offered by mobile phones."

Party leader Michael Howard said the new role would replace \"inconspicuous\" police authorities. He said the new office would not only provide greater accountability but also allow for more effective representation of community needs. The proposal is part of the party's efforts to decentralize power and give citizens more control over their local law enforcement. According to Howard, the current system of police authorities has failed to engage the public and has led to a lack of trust in the police. Under the proposed system, each local authority would be responsible for electing their own police commissioner, who would then work closely with the local police force to ensure that community concerns are addressed. The commissioners would also have the power to set policing priorities and allocate resources accordingly. Howard believes that this approach will lead to a more responsive and effective police service, one that is truly accountable to the people it serves. The plan has been welcomed by many who see it as a positive step towards creating safer and more secure communities."

The tests would cover infectious diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, as well as checking for signs of cancer and other serious health conditions. Those who fail the health check would not be allowed to enter the country. The proposal has sparked controversy, with some accusing the Conservatives of scaremongering and playing on public fears about immigration. Critics argue that the measures are unnecessary and would create unnecessary bureaucracy and expense. Others say that the focus should be on improving healthcare services for all, rather than targeting specific groups. Despite these criticisms, the Conservatives remain committed to their plan, saying it is necessary to protect public health and ensure that the NHS is not overburdened by those who may require costly medical treatment. They also point out that many countries already have similar requirements in place for immigrants. Overall, the proposed health checks represent just one aspect of the Conservatives' broader approach to immigration, which includes stricter border controls and a cap on non-EU migration. With the election looming, it remains to be seen whether these policies will resonate with voters or prove to be a vote-loser."

In addition to coaxing ever larger and more tangible objects into a regime of quantum behavior, this new capability has encouraged ideas of using mechanical oscillators in the processing and communication of quantum information and as precision force sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit. But the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Indeed, early optomechanical proposals noted the possibility to escape this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light.

By cooling a mechanical oscillator to its quantum ground state, it is possible to achieve a level of precision measurement that was previously unimaginable.

Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness.

The Mirror Symmetry conjecture states that there exists a dual Calabi-Yau manifold $Y$, such that the cohomology rings of $X$ and $Y$ are isomorphic. The first construction of the mirror partner uses the fact that the hypersurface $X_m$ can be represented as a fibration over a lower-dimensional base manifold $B$. The fibers of this fibration are topologically trivial, and the monodromy group of the fibration is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the complement of the discriminant locus in $B$. By taking the quotient of $X_m$ by this monodromy group, we obtain a new Calabi-Yau manifold $Y_1$, which is a candidate for the mirror partner of $X$. The second construction of the mirror partner uses the fact that the hypersurface $X_m$ can also be realized as a degeneration of a higher-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold $Z$. Specifically, $X_m$ can be obtained by shrinking the size of certain cycles in $Z$ to zero. By taking the limit of large volume of these cycles, we obtain another Calabi-Yau manifold $Y_2$, which is also a candidate for the mirror partner of $X$. It would be interesting to explore the relationship between these two constructions of the mirror partner and understand how they are related to each other. One approach to doing this is to study the behavior of the Hodge structure on the cohomology of $X$ under the action of the monodromy group, and compare it with the Hodge structure on the cohomology of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$."

We use a simple and efficient algorithm to detect close encounters, and switch to a smaller step size during these events to ensure accurate trajectory propagation. This approach enables us to maintain the long-term accuracy of the simulation while significantly improving computational efficiency. Our MVS integrator can handle both collisional and non-collisional close encounters, and we demonstrate its performance through several test cases involving Earth-Moon and Jupiter-Io system simulations."

A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In reality, due to the exponentially increasing the hilbert-space dimension with respective to the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For $n$-partite greenberger-horne-zeilinger (ghz)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise.

A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for entangled states. The witness operator is typically a tensor product of local observables, which are measured on each subsystem of the composite state. By performing these measurements, one can determine whether the state is entangled or not. However, it's important to note that the absence of entanglement witness does not necessarily mean that the state is separable, as there may exist other entanglement measures that could still indicate non-trivial entanglement properties.

Dry (or the \"loss-cone\") emris, previsouly considered as the main emri sources for the laser interferometer space antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. In this letter, we highlight an alternative emri formation channel: (wet) emri formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (mbhs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are intially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the mbh - this process boosts the formation rate of emris in such galaxies by orders of magnitude.",

Dry (or the \"loss-cone\") EMRIs, previously considered as the main EMRI sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are primarily generated by the gravitational interaction between a small object (such as a star or a black hole) and a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy. On the other hand, wet EMRIs are thought to arise from the tidal disruption of a star that wanders too close to a supermassive black hole, resulting in a disk of debris around the black hole that can lead to the formation of a binary system. Both types of EMRIs offer unique opportunities for testing general relativity and studying the properties of black holes, making them promising targets for future astrophysical observations."

        "llama_complete_output": "Weight pruning has been widely acknowledged as a straightforward and effective method to eliminate redundancy in deep neural networks (dnn), thereby achieving acceleration on various platforms. However, most of the pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity, which lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited applicability in real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, recent studies have focused on developing novel pruning methods that can strike a better balance between accuracy and efficiency. One such approach is the use of adaptive pruning strategies that dynamically adjust the level of pruning based on the input data and computational resources available. Another promising direction is the integration of weight pruning with other technique such as quantization and knowledge distillation, which can further improve the efficiency of the models without sacrificing their accuracy."

Constructing a more closely matched control group by matching a subset of the overall control group to the treated group may result in less bias. We study this phenomenon in simulation studies. We study the effect of mountaintop removal mining (mrm) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that makes use of the increase in mrm following the 1990 clean air act amendments. For a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of mrm on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and found a 95\\% confidence interval that contains substantial adverse effects along with no effect and small beneficial effects.",

Constructing a more closely matched control group by matching a subset of the overall control group to the treated group can help mitigate this issue. However, even with careful matching, there may still be unobserved differences between the groups that could affect the outcome. Therefore, it is essential to use appropriate methods to account for these potential biases when interpreting the results of a difference-in-differences analysis. One approach is to use instrumental variables, which are variables that affect the treatment status but not directly the outcome, to identify causal effects. Another option is to use regression discontinuity designs, which compare outcomes at different levels of a threshold for receiving the treatment, allowing researchers to isolate causal effects from confounding factors. By using these techniques, policymakers and researchers can gain insights into the effectiveness of interventions while minimizing the risk of biased estimates."

One common way to perform VPC is through the use of plots such as histograms or density plots, which allow for a visual comparison of the two distributions. Additionally, statistical tests such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test can also be employed to quantify the difference between the predicted and observed distributions.

Now, I want to tell you about the Yap because their form of money was unique and forward-thinking. Instead of using physical currency like coins or paper bills, the Yap used large stones, called Rai, as their medium of exchange. These stones were valuable not only for their size and weight but also for their historical significance and artistic value. They were often carved with intricate designs and patterns, making them both functional and beautiful. The use of Rai as money was not just limited to buying goods and services but also played a significant role in their social and cultural practices. For instance, Rai was used as a form of dowry during weddings, and it was also given as a gift to the groom's family. The Yap believed that the more Rai one owned, the wealthier and more respected they would be in their community. This belief gave rise to a thriving economy based on these stone discs. Fast forward to today, and we can see similarities between the Yap's use of Rai and modern digital currencies like Bitcoin. Just like how the Yap valued Rai for its rarity and uniqueness, digital currencies rely on complex algorithms to ensure their scarcity and security. Moreover, the decentralized nature of digital currencies, free from government control, echoes the way the Yap traded Rai independently of external influences. Perhaps the future of money lies in blending traditional values with cutting-edge technology, taking inspiration from cultures like the Yap who innovated in their own unique ways."

I'll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can, and actually is changing the world, and whose name is people power. I'll start with an anecdote, or for those of you who are familiar with the concept, a small example of how people power has been used to make a difference in our society. A few years ago, a group of residents in a small town in Poland decided to take matters into their own hands and address the issue of air pollution. They organized themselves, conducted research, and began advocating for change. Through their efforts, they were able to raise awareness, mobilize support, and eventually push for policy changes that improved the quality of the air they breathed. This is just one instance of how ordinary people can come together and achieve extraordinary things when they work towards a common goal. The idea of people power may seem simple, but its impact cannot be overstated. It's what drives social movements, brings about political change, and inspires innovation. When individuals unite around a shared vision, they become an unstoppable force for good. And in today's digital age, technology has made it easier than ever for people to connect, collaborate, and amplify their voices. So let me leave you with a question: what if we could harness the power of people to tackle some of the biggest challenges facing our world today? What if we could create a global movement that prioritizes sustainability, equality, and justice? The possibilities are endless, and I believe that each and every one of us has the potential to contribute to creating a better future. Thank you."

With the majority of refugees living in urban areas, there is a strong need for a paradigm shift in how we address their needs and provide support. Traditionally, refugee assistance has focused on providing aid in camp settings, but this approach is no longer sufficient given the changing demographics of displacement. Urban refugees face unique challenges such as lack of access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. They often struggle to integrate into local communities and are at risk of being marginalized and exploited. Therefore, it is essential to develop innovative solutions tailored to the specific needs of urban refugees. This includes partnering with local organizations and governments to create inclusive policies and programs that promote social cohesion and economic self-sufficiency. Additionally, technology can play a vital role in connecting refugees with critical services and resources, as well as facilitating communication and community building among dispersed populations. By adopting a more comprehensive and sustainable approach, we can empower urban refugees to rebuild their lives and contribute positively to their host societies."

The success of Sputnik caught the attention of scientists, politicians, and the general public around the globe. It was a wake-up call for America, which had previously been focused on developing nuclear weapons and neglected the field of rocketry. In response, President Eisenhower created NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and initiated Project Mercury, aiming to launch an American astronaut into space. The space race continued until July 20, 1969, when Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon's surface, marking a historic victory for the United States. However, the impact of Sputnik went beyond just winning a race; it opened up new possibilities for humanity, inspiring generations of scientists and engineers to explore the unknown."

As a result of their conversation, Roosevelt later signed legislation establishing Yosemite National Park, preserving its stunning landscapes and wildlife habitats for all time."

They imagine themselves basking in a never-ending sense of joy, free from all worries and cares. Others, however, are more hesitant. They wonder what the catch might be, what hidden costs there might be to such a deal. Would they still be able to think for themselves, or would they become nothing more than a mindless drone, trapped in a perpetual state of pleasure? And what about the people they love - would they be left behind, or could they also join in on this pleasurable existence? Ultimately, the decision to plug into such a machine is a deeply personal one, influenced by one's values, beliefs, and experiences.

The smell was overwhelming, and I couldn't help but feel mortified. I quickly apologized and tried to clean up the mess as best as I could, but the damage had already been done. The patient's family members were present in the room and witnessed the entire incident, which made it even more awkward for me.

Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies relates to robustness. Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize their internal physiology and behavior to adapt to changing conditions, such as varying temperatures or humidity levels. This allows them to survive in a wide range of ecosystems, from the frozen tundra to the hottest deserts. In contrast, human technologies often require carefully controlled environments to function optimally. For example, computers and smartphones need specific temperature and humidity ranges to operate efficiently. But what if we could develop technologies that are more robust, like cockroaches? Imagine a world where our devices and machines could continue to function even in extreme weather conditions, without the need for specialized storage or maintenance. By studying the unique properties of cockroaches and other resilient organisms, scientists may unlock new insights into building more robust technologies that can better withstand the challenges of our dynamic environment."
