Normally no one would care, certainly not i, but as i was flipping thru the channels i caught a glipse of jonothan, equally narcissistic and dull looking at a empty space on rodeo dr speak (in a public voice) 'i am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' and i was hooked.

His confident yet narcissistic demeanor made him strangely captivating, reminding me of Rocco from a previous reality show."

I did a lot of god's green leaf, after a long time, i listened to a lot of nevermore (something i should have started doing much earlier) and read a lot. I finished three books over the weekend - bruce sterling's heavy weather, larry niven's world of ptavvs and octavia butler's parable of the sower. Heavy weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future usa, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced and altogether very convincing, i must confess that i failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, i guess.",
        "llama_polish_token_output": "This was a satisfying weekend. I indulged in plenty of green tea, finally taking the time to enjoy some long overdue relaxation. I also made a point to catch up on some reading, finishing three engaging novels: Bruce Sterling's \"Heavy Weather,\" Larry Niven's \"World of Ptavvs,\" and Octavia Butler's \"Parable of the Sower.\" \"Heavy Weather\" offered a thrilling cyberpunk adventure set in a dystopian future America, ravaged by climate change and societal collapse. Although it was intelligently crafted, well-paced, and thoroughly believable, I couldn't help but feel that something was missing in terms of emotional resonance. Don't get me wrong \u2013 the story and its characters were certainly well-developed and vividly rendered, but ultimately, it didn't leave a lasting impression on me. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I can't help feeling that it fell short of being truly exceptional."

As a non-american blogger i've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since i started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) i suppose i'd better say something. Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.",

As a non-American blogger, I have been hesitant to participate in certain discussions, especially those surrounding flags. However, now that I have broached the topic, I feel compelled to express my thoughts. Initially, I believe that the notion of enacting legislation prohibiting flag-burning is utterly absurd. By granting a symbol - any symbol - such automatic veneration and safeguarding, one takes a subtle yet significant step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are inherently ephemeral - their meanings are not innate but rather derived from how they are perceived and utilized by individuals."

I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it. It might sound like nothing, but while in combat it could potentially break your combo.",

I dislike prequels because they move the story backward instead of forward, which can be problematic (a concern applicable to all prequels). However, it does offer more depth to the narrative. The combat feels clumsy and lacks the precision that Arkham City achieved. As of my writing this recommendation (October 26, 2013), a game-breaking bug prevents a side mission from completion (although the main story remains unaffected). Additionally, some gadgets are assigned to an inconvenient keybind that requires an excessive amount of finger movement across the keyboard, potentially disrupting combos during combat. "

I also feel like this game is a lot more cut scene than it is game, and i end up just sitting around drumming my fingers a lot.",
        "llama_polish_token_output": "I apologize sincerely, as I strive to be supportive of free-to-play games and independent developers. However, I must admit that I did not enjoy this particular title. The game's description seemed tailored to my preferences, but unfortunately, its execution fell short. As an enthusiast of puzzle and exploration games, I found the experience to be counterintuitive, and even after referring to tutorials, I failed to discover any enjoyment in the gameplay. Moreover, the absence of a pause button was glaring, especially given the time-sensitive nature of many in-game sequences. Additionally, I felt that the game consisted of an excessive amount of cutscenes, leaving me idle for extended periods."

Furthermore, most existing detectors focus on detection accuracy, which is not well-aligned with the goal of maintaining the trustworthiness of product evaluations. To address the challenges, we formulate a minimax game where the spammers and spam detectors compete with each other on their practical goals that are not solely based on detection accuracy.

By learning this essential component from observed node interactions, our approach offers greater adaptability while sidestepping the limitations of human-defined edges."

A corpus of potential seeds will often contain thousands of similar inputs. This lack of diversity can lead to wasted fuzzing effort by exhaustive mutation from all available seeds. To address this, fuzzers come with distillation tools (e.g., afl-cmin) that select the smallest subset of seeds that triggers the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. Common practice suggests that minimizing the number and cumulative size of the seeds leads to more efficient fuzzing, which we explore systematically.

(ii) accurately predict the probability of transferring a quantum system to a desired quantum state through stochastic sequential measurements. (iii) efficiently reconstruct the spectral density of environmental noise sources by orthogonalising their filter functions in the frequency domain, tailoring them to our designed quantum sensor. Accomplishing these goals will significantly enhance our ability to study and manipulate open quantum systems, thereby advancing quantum science and technology. "

        "llama_polish_token_output": "\"Where does all the carbon we release end up? Carbon operates within a natural cycle, present in all living organisms: in soil, oceans, atmospheric gases, and subterranean rocks. When vegetation and other organisms perish, much of their stored carbon returns to the atmosphere, awaiting reabsorption by newly grown plants. However, over millions of years, some carbon stored in primeval trees and marine life solidifies into rock formations, while another portion transforms into fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Geological occurrences like volcanic eruptions liberate some of the entrapped carbon from rocks. Similarly, human endeavors, including the combustion of fossil fuels, release additional quantities of this ancient carbon. Currently, human activities unleash approximately 60 times more carbon annually than all volcanoes combined.\" "

Robust systems are stable in complex and new environments. Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize running over rough terrain. When we put a jet pack on them, or give them a perturbation like an earthquake, we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs allow them to self-stabilize without using any of their brainpower. They can go over complex terrain like grass, no problem, and not get destabilized. We discovered a new behavior where, because of their shape, they actually roll automatically to their side to go through this artificial test bit of grass.robust systems can perform multiple tasks with the same structure. Here's a new behavior we've discovered.",
        "llama_polish_token_output": "Even nature's most undesirable organisms hold valuable secrets, but who would desire a horde of cockroaches approaching them? Yet, one of the primary contrasts between natural and human-made technologies lies in resilience. Resilient systems remain steady in diverse and unpredictable environments. Notably, cockroaches can autonomously stabilize themselves when traversing uneven terrain. When we equipped them with a jet pack or introduced disturbances like an earthquake, we found that their superbly adjusted limbs allowed them to regain stability sans cognitive effort. They can navigate intricate terrain like grass with ease and don't become unstable. Our research revealed a novel behavior where, due to their form, they instinctively tumble onto their sides to traverse the synthetic grass challenge. Robust systems can accomplish various tasks utilizing the same architecture. This newly discovered behavior highlights their adaptability."
