If all goes well this week, we will be set for closing a week from wednesday. I was up until after 3:00am last night watching movies with bethany. There has been a lot of movie watching going on around here lately. Here's my rundown; last night we watched thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better then i expected. Then we watched gigli, yeah it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves.",

The prospect of receiving the keys at the closing fills me with anticipation. With some luck, everything should align perfectly for the closing scheduled to happen just over a week from now. Bethany and I found ourselves engrossed in films until past three in the morning recently. Indeed, we've been indulging in quite a few movie nights. To give you a summary, we watched \"Thirteen\" last night\u2014a film I believe every parent of a teenager ought to watch, which turned out to be surprisingly good. Following that, we viewed \"Gigli,\" and unfortunately, it lived up to its poor reputation as publicized. Yet, we couldn't resist seeing it with our own eyes."

But now there are two great new shows on tv and i have been watching both religiously for the last week. Blow out the gayest concept ever that seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist jonothan antin wants build a second location to his incredibly popular west hollywood salon but this time in beverly hills. Normally no one would care, certainly not i, but as i was flipping thru the channels i caught a glipse of jonothan, equally narcissistic and dull looking at a empty space on rodeo dr speak (in a public voice) 'i am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!' and i was hooked. Not since rocco have i found such a moron compelling tv watching.",
        "gpt4_rewrite_output": "Television during summer was traditionally a wasteland, dominated by reruns. However, I've recently found myself captivated by a couple of new series that have premiered during this time. One such show, \"Blow Out,\" is a remarkably unique concept that surprisingly doesn't feature any openly gay individuals, despite what the title might imply. The show stars celebrity hairstylist Jonathan Antin, who's set on opening a new salon in the upscale neighborhood of Beverly Hills\u2014a stark departure from his already successful establishment in West Hollywood. Normally, this wouldn't pique my interest, but I stumbled upon Jonathan on television, declaring his ambitious plans on Rodeo Drive with undeniable vanity and ambition, and I couldn't turn away. His commitment to creating \"the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!\" was oddly fascinating. Not since the reality show featuring the chef Rocco have I been so drawn to a program for its enthralling, if not eccentric, personality."

My energy to sketch or draw is practically nonexistent, a situation worsened by a lack of adequate rest, which only intensifies my discomfort. Currently, my spirits are low, but I'm optimistic about recovery. On a brighter note, my mother's recent surgery was successful to some extent.

Urllink robert rubin told npr's marketplace today that bush could have achieved the same stimulus effect without the long term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low and middle income persons. Ah, robert rubin. The sound of his name is music to our ears. Quick: name one bush administration cabinet official on the domestic side with rubin's gravitas. Still thinking? it'll come to you... 2. We can't give the republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'",
        "gpt4_rewrite_output": "In the analysis provided in a recent post, two significant issues were identified regarding the current economic approach. Firstly, while President Bush is indeed attempting to revitalize the economy, his strategy may be flawed. Robert Rubin, speaking on NPR's Marketplace, suggested an alternative that could stimulate the economy without saddling the country with prolonged debt: enacting temporary tax cuts targeted at low and middle-income earners. Rubin's insight and reputation bring a sense of assurance, starkly contrasting with the search for an equally esteemed domestic official within the Bush administration. Secondly, the notion of handing over governance to the Republicans exclusively during times of conflict is challenged by the fact that they have cleverly designed the 'war on terrorism' to be a never-ending, worldwide struggle. This perpetual state of war calls into question the wisdom of such a power handover based on wartime competencies alone."

Republican Senators, in a show of defiance, held what can only be called a 39-hour marathon of grievance. Despite the reality that I mostly avoided the spectacle, my curiosity got the better of me a couple of times. The point of this drawn-out exercise seemed to be a frustrated reaction to the Democrats' refusal to confirm four controversial judicial nominees proposed by President Bush. The Republicans seemed to be on a quest to demonstrate their dissatisfaction, all the while ignoring that the Democrats have given the green light to 168 of Bush's other court picks. But for Republicans, evidently hungry for unchecked influence, that significant number was still unsatisfactory. They appear to operate with the false belief that they possess widespread support to indulge in such dramatics."

I did a lot of god's green leaf, after a long time, i listened to a lot of nevermore (something i should have started doing much earlier) and read a lot. I finished three books over the weekend - bruce sterling's heavy weather, larry niven's world of ptavvs and octavia butler's parable of the sower. Heavy weather was a good cyberpunk romp through a near-future usa, devastated by global warming and general anarchy. While it was clever, well-paced and altogether very convincing, i must confess that i failed to come away with any really significant sensations about the story or the characters. Not that both aren't well constructed and vividly etched - it's a good book, but not a great one, i guess.",

I indulged in nature, delved deeply into the band Nevermore's discography, an endeavor I regret not undertaking sooner, and devoted a substantial amount of time to reading, completing three novels. Among them was Bruce Sterling's \"Heavy Weather,\" a compelling narrative set in a dystopian near-future United States ravaged by climate change and chaos. The book's quick wit, brisk narrative pace, and credible world-building were impressive, yet it fell short of leaving a lasting impact on me regarding its plot or characters. Both were impressively crafted and clearly portrayed, but somehow it didn't elevate to greatness in my eyes, remaining merely a solid read."

By gary fineout and alfonso chardy the citizenship ceremony in jacksonville seemed to go off as usual, with a crowd of nearly 200 people going home as new americans. Just before the new citizens left the june 29 event, an immigration official directing the swearing-in urged them to stop by a voter registration table -- a not uncommon sight at naturalization ceremonies. But this table was unusual: those handing out forms were republican volunteers -- and the party affiliation box had been checked off ahead of time to make all of the new voters members of the gop. All of it was suspicious to linda cross, who was there to watch her husband, dario cruz, take his citizenship oath.",
        "gpt4_rewrite_output": "The naturalization ceremony in Jacksonville, which celebrated nearly 200 new American citizens, encountered controversy after GOP volunteers were reported to have pre-registered new citizens as Republicans. The incident, highlighted by witness Linda Cross during her husband Dario Cruz's citizenship oath, led to criticism and subsequent relocation of voter registration efforts at such events. GOP activists were scrutinized for their presence and actions at the voter registration table, where they distributed forms with pre-selected party affiliations. The original instruction to visit the voter registration table by an immigration official was standard, but the involvement of partisan volunteers raised concerns. This report was brought to light by journalists Gary Fineout and Alfonso Chardy."

As a non-american blogger i've been a little reluctant to get involved in some of these discussions, particularly the bits about flags, but since i started it (the subject, not the flag-burning) i suppose i'd better say something. Firstly, i think that the idea of having a law against flag-burning is completely nuts. The moment you start according a symbol - any symbol - that kind of automatic reverence and protection, you've taken a small but important step towards totalitarianism. Symbols are kind of fickle - they don't a priori represent anything in themselves; it's what they are perceived as meaning or made to represent that's important.",

Though I'm a non-American blogger and was initially hesitant to wade into debates about flag-related issues, I feel compelled to comment since I broached the topic. To be clear, I find the notion of legislation prohibiting flag desecration to be ludicrous. By elevating a symbolic entity\u2014any symbol\u2014to a status that requires mandatory respect and legal safeguarding, we edge closer to authoritarianism. The nature of symbols is inherently unstable; they hold no intrinsic meaning but rather gain significance through collective interpretation and assigned representation."

        "gpt4_rewrite_output": "On Monday, December 11, 2000, John Yurkanin, Chief Operating Officer, addressed all Power Exchange (PX) market participants regarding the detrimental impact of recent California ISO emergency tariff revisions on the PX day-ahead auction. The new rules, which combine soft and hard price caps, have created an untenable level of risk for participants and potentially fail to achieve the intended reduction of real-time energy purchases by the ISO. Consequently, suppliers may continue to favor the ISO's superior pricing. The PX has urgently approached Terry Winter at the ISO to request the reinstatement of flexible bid adjustments for any submitted schedules at prices that are deemed appropriate."

We had countered their standard of a 'materially weaker' entity with a more definitive benchmark, suggesting that a downgrade below BBB- by Standard & Poor's should constitute a trigger event.

The enjoyment of playing with friends is hindered by a system where essential in-game currency - gold - cannot be earned. Gold's significance is underscored by a daily limit, a logical move given it's the key to unlocking in-game content.

I quite hate pre-quals as it's technically going backwards in a story and not forwards (this is an issue for every pre-qual). Granted it offers more storywise. The combat feels sloppy and doesn't feel as sharp as arkham city managed to make it. As of writing this recommendation (26/10/2013) there is a game breaking bug that stops a side mission from ever being completed (main story not effected). Some gadgets are put at a rediculous hotkey that makes your hand have to travel the whole keyboard to get to it.

The combat system is a letdown; it lacks the precision that Arkham City achieved. At the time of this review (October 26, 2013), there's a critical bug in the game that renders one of the side missions incomplete, although the main storyline remains unaffected. Additionally, some gadgets are assigned to inconvenient hotkeys, requiring an awkward stretch across the keyboard, which can disrupt the fluidity of combat and could ruin your combo."

The enemies strike a good balance in terms of resilience, assuming the player adeptly manages elemental forces and upgrades. The upgrade mechanics are well-tuned, avoiding unnecessary complexity. Ammo scarcity and various elemental effects encourage the strategic use of an array of distinct weapons, deviating significantly from the generic, randomized weapons found in games like Borderlands.

It baffles me as to why shooting capabilities are determined by a player's height. It seems illogical that a character who is slightly taller at 1.74 meters wouldn't be able to achieve the same level of shooting proficiency as one who is 1.71 meters. Personally, I'm 1.87 meters tall in real life, and I modeled my first player after my own height. To my disappointment, I discovered that my player was capped at a shooting skill of 89, with no possibility of improvement. This limitation feels discriminatory and arbitrary. What is more frustrating is that the game fails to convey this information upfront. I was not informed of this restriction upon creating my character, nor was I warned when I hit this unanticipated ceiling after weeks of dedicated play.

I've since picked up a 3rd party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. Plus the aiming reticule is on the small side and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, its been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first person shooter/beat em up is great. I've been playing it as often as i can get away...

To circumvent such devastating losses in the future, I've integrated an unofficial modification for saving. Additionally, the target marker is a tad too diminutive, and the zoom function could be more effective. Nevertheless, the experience has been exciting. Typically, zombie themes don't entice me, but this game's fusion of tactical elements, various missions, and first-person combat has captured my attention.

Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very generation one. But aside from that, it's actually a very fun game. The combat mechanics are extremely well done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, and woven seamlessly into combos, making it quite unlike high moon's excellent war for/fall of cybertron games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g. Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster.",

The game dazzles with a cell-shaded aesthetic that pays homage to the first-generation Transformers. Yet, it's more than a trip down memory lane; the game impresses with its dynamic combat system. Seamlessly integrating transformations into fluid combos is not only thrilling but often essential for battle strategy, setting it apart from the acclaimed Cybertron series by High Moon Studios. While melee attacks take center stage, the game design cleverly necessitates the occasional switch to ranged weapons when facing certain adversaries like the Seekers."

I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments (where you can play batman + 1 more), and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the apc commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the breaks to skid around corners (and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable!)",

The highlight for me was the innovative 'dual play' feature, allowing control of Batman alongside an ally, enhancing the gameplay experience. I also appreciated the versatility of control options, with the standard controller suffice for general gameplay, while the precision of mouse and keyboard was ideal for the tank combat scenarios.

I play on an i5 Pentium with an Nvidia GeForce 710M, 8GB of RAM, and it delivers smooth performance on Windows 8.1.\n  \n- **Controls**: Flexibility is key here; the game supports both keyboard and mouse or an Xbox controller for gameplay, offering accessibility for players' preferred input methods."

Since I've been immersed in the game and invested significant money into it, I can confidently say it stands as one of the top multiplayer games out there, an excellent alternative for times when the appeal of CS:GO dims."

Gameplay is also solid, art design is beautiful, music is surprisingly high quality and appropriate, the story/world has me interested, and the puzzles are fun.

If you've played any rpg since the dawn of video game rpgs you will laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an rpg before then you should still enjoy the game for its humor. If you played final fantasy 7 or x you absolutely need to play this game, without giving too much away...

The combat is the right amount of challenge but it's more on the easy side. Leveling up batman wasn't very satisfying.

Nonetheless, with more games on the horizon, this might well be addressed in future installments. The combat strikes a balance, tending towards the easier side, offering a moderate level of challenge. The process of powering up Batman fell a bit flat for me, however.

The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is nice, but paired together they make some truly beautiful and impacting moments. The script runs the gammut from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and does this while turning rpg tropes on their head. And all of this without touching on the world, characters, story, gameplay... I could write whole pages about it. But instead, i'll just say this: if you like rpgs, play this game. If you like video games, play this game. If you have seven free hours between now and your death, play this game.",
        "gpt4_rewrite_output": "\"Undertale\" is more than just the elements it's composed of. With its retro-styled visuals and delightful soundtrack, the game expertly crafts moments that truly resonate. The writing is masterful, effortlessly shifting from humor to drama, from sorrow to hope, while cleverly subverting typical role-playing game conventions. Yet, this only brushes the surface of \"Undertale's\" rich world, intricate characters, compelling narrative, and engaging gameplay. It's a title I could expound on at length, but to keep it brief: whether you're a fan of RPGs or video games in general, or simply someone with a spare seven hours, \"Undale\" is a must-play experience."

But if forgetting all these bugs, crashes and drawdistance 'bugs', this is really fantastic game, they made huge effort on quests, some of them really emotional and deep, lots of side quests, and the fact that your decision effects a lot in this game.

Prior to this update, from versions 1.00 to 1.03, I experienced a smooth run without crashes or bugs. Post-update, there are noticeable issues with the rendering distance as well, with objects and characters popping into view only when approaching them closely. Despite these technical issues, The Witcher 3 is an outstanding title, especially due to the effort put into crafting its quests\u2014many of which are emotionally resonant and deeply engaging. The plethora of side quests and the impactful nature of player choices add to the game's richness. Having invested over 50 hours into it, I'm still enthralled and continuing my adventure."

After those few enjoyable hours you'll begin to see that the only thing left the game has to offer is repetition in it's combat, enemies and game play. The one major high point for the game is that the developers are working hard and do semi-frequent updates that generally include a lot of content from sweeping changes to some of the game's systems, new warframes and other tweaks/features. It's a good game to play casually. Though i doubt it will hold your attention beyond a few months unless you just really like grinding. The upside to all of this is that the game is free so i'd recommend trying it out. If you're looking for a quick fix, try it out.",

For those who enjoy a leisurely gaming experience, Warframe can be a fitting choice, albeit there's a possibility that the game might not sustain your interest in the long term, particularly if repetitious tasks are not your preference. Nevertheless, given that the game can be enjoyed at no cost, it is certainly worth giving it a try, especially for players seeking a brief and enjoyable distraction."

In this game you go about, absorbing ever bigger things to grow bigger and absorb bigger things. But the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be, the levels not inventive and what is in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show but, one that makes you rather depressed and rethink whether being alive is all it should be.

I was under the impression that it would be a computer adaptation of \"Katamari Damacy,\" which was a delightful and well-received title on the PlayStation 2. However, that's not the case. The objective is to essentially navigate around, assimilating objects of increasing size to gradually escalate your own dimensions. Regrettably, the experience is hindered by clunky gameplay and uninspired level design. What's more, the game's ambiance is not the charming kind of bizarre; it's disconcertingly morose, to the point of prompting existential contemplation. The manner in which 'alive' entities are portrayed, from tiny domestic animals to humans, gives one the unnerving suspicion that the developers might have a penchant for taxidermy."

The game starts you off and says you need to pick a side: republican or democrat, there is no independent, or third party. A little dissapointed, but still optimistic, i carried on to see what i could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to mess around with.

The iconic power armor, a hallmark of past Fallout games, is disappointingly easy to acquire early on, with an abundance of power cores readily available at trader locations, lessening its significance. The story and overall game quality are average, at best, a stark contrast to its predecessors. Unlike Fallout 3, which was plagued with crashes, this game boasts remarkable stability\u2014the one aspect where it does excel.

The artificial intelligence of the opponents is disappointing, with enemies possessing an unrealistic awareness of the player's location once detected. Additionally, foes display an unreasonably high level of shooting accuracy, reminiscent of the frustrating experience in the first Ghost Warrior title. Save points and checkpoints are poorly implemented, further aggravating the player experience. The narrative fails to engage, leaving much to be desired. Overall, the game is not recommended unless heavily discounted, and even then, it's considered a tedious task rather than an enjoyable pastime.

Bullets are subject to gravity, making long-range combat a matter of skillful, brief bursts to ensure accuracy. The game abandons the concept of infinite ammo supplies \u2014 if you consistently reload before emptying your magazine, you'll end up with a collection of partially spent clips. Stamina is finite; too much running impairs your shooting precision as your character struggles to regain composure and breath.

Widely recognized for the iconic 70s horror movie 'Halloween', her death follows a battle with cancer. Hill co-authored the 1978 slasher film featuring Jamie Lee Curtis as the imperiled babysitter. Under John Carpenter's direction, the movie grossed $60 million globally, setting a benchmark for indie films at the time. Hill's career in film was marked by other collaborations with Carpenter, such as \"Escape from New York\" and \"The Fog\". A New Jersey native, Hill's journey to success began at the bottom, advancing from a production assistant to an assistant director, and ultimately a distinguished role as a second-unit director before teaming up with Carpenter. She broke into the male-dominated world of the 70s film industry, cementing her legacy as one of its trailblazing female figures."

But more and more ipod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. It is called \"podcasting\" and its strongest proponent is former mtv host and vj (video jockey) adam curry. Podcasting takes its name from the apple ipod, although you do not need an ipod to create one or to listen to a podcast. A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a pc, and some editing software. They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them, all for free.",

In addition to coaxing ever larger and more tangible objects into a regime of quantum behavior, this new capability has encouraged ideas of using mechanical oscillators in the processing and communication of quantum information and as precision force sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit. But the effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity precludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat states or energy squeezed states. Indeed, early optomechanical proposals noted the possibility to escape this restriction by creating strong quadratic coupling of motion to light. Although there have been experimental demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, these have not yet accessed nonclassical states of motion.",

It has spawned the concept of employing these mechanical oscillators for tasks such as the handling and transfer of quantum information and for force detection with precision surpassing the conventional quantum constraints. However, the predominantly linear relationship between motion alongside light or electrical phenomena limits the range of attainable quantum states of motion. For instance, some proposed desired states, like the cat states or states with minimally uncertain energy levels, remain elusive due to this predicament. Early theoretical works in the field of optomechanics have suggested that a stronger, quadratic link between motion and light could overcome these limitations.

Among this family, we identify a tracking solution with a single parameter to control simultaneously the fidelity of the transfer, the population of the excited state, and robustness. We define a measure of the robustness of an uh-fidelity transfer as the minimum percentile deviation on the pulse areas at which the infidelity rises above $10^{-4}$.

This technique employs time regularization to maintain the stability characteristic of symplectic integrators and intelligently reduces the effective step size during planetary encounters. Employing a sophisticated mvs algorithm, it facilitates integration over large time steps when planets are not closely interacting. Our findings illustrate that the algorithm effectively manages near-collision events, simulating scenarios with planet separations just fractions of their physical sizes, using consistent time steps applicable to less disturbed systems like the solar system. The integrator's performance excels in extended simulations, such as tracking six super-earths in a dense scattering scenario for 50,000 years, showcasing superior energy conservation when contrasted with hybrid algorithms like the mercury method, and doing so at a comparable computational cost."

A widely used tool for detecting entanglement is entanglement witness, where the measurement of the witness operator is guaranteed to be positive for all separable states and can be negative for certain entangled states. In reality, due to the exponentially increasing the hilbert-space dimension with respective to the system size, it is very challenging to construct an efficient entanglement witness for general multipartite entangled states. For $n$-partite greenberger-horne-zeilinger (ghz)-like states, the most robust witness scheme requires $n+1$ local measurement settings and can tolerate up to $1/2$ white noise.

In this letter, we highlight an alternative emri formation channel: (wet) emri formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (mbhs). In this channel, the accretion disk captures stellar-mass black holes that are intially moving on inclined orbits, and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the mbh - this process boosts the formation rate of emris in such galaxies by orders of magnitude.",

These dry EMRIs arise amid dense star clusters near galactic centers due to interactions between multiple stars and gravitational ensnarement. However, we introduce a different process for creating EMRIs in this communication. This process involves wet EMRIs, which are formed with the help of the dense material spiraling into massive black holes (MBHs) at the center of galaxies. As stellar black holes get caught in the accretion disk's grip while traversing oblique paths, they are gradually pulled into a trajectory that leads them into the vicinity of the MBH.

Additionally, tackling intricate and unpredictable nonlinear dynamic challenges is feasible with an RC system composed of 24 STNOs, as proven by successful application to a second-order nonlinear dynamic system and NARMA10 tasks."

In this paper, we identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: the fewer the items reporting a given signal, the higher the share of the overall traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect emerges when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items. Using simulations, we analyze how the strength of the effect changes with assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also test our predictions experimentally in an online experiment with human participants. Our findings have important implications to understand the spread of misinformation.",
        "gpt4_rewrite_output": "Algorithms that determine rankings are vital in shaping online experiences, from search queries to personalized suggestions. Our research unveils an unexpected outcome of algorithms that prioritize popular items: when signals are scant, a minority of items disproportionately captures more traffic - a phenomenon we term the \"few-get-richer\" effect. This tendency arises particularly when item categories are limited (such as news sources with distinct political biases) and rankings favor those with higher popularity stats. Our analytical work reveals that this effect takes hold as users are more inclined to engage with items at the top of the list, coupled with their varied tastes among the item categories. Through simulation, we explore variation in this effect, contingent on different scenarios and user behaviors. Additionally, we confirm our theoretical findings by conducting an online experiment with actual users. These insights could prove crucial in understanding and potentially curbing the dissemination of misinformation across the web."

However, most of the pruning techniques are essentially trade-offs between model accuracy and regularity which lead to impaired inference accuracy and limited on-device acceleration performance. To solve the problem, we introduce a new sparsity dimension, namely pattern-based sparsity that comprises pattern and connectivity sparsity, and becoming both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different dnn structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly efficient dnn execution on mobile platforms.",

However, conventional pruning methods typically require a compromise between maintaining model precision and enhancing regularity, which can result in decreased accuracy during inference and suboptimal acceleration when used on actual devices. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel approach to sparsity\u2014pattern-based sparsity\u2014that incorporates both pattern and connectivity reductions, making it both accurate and amenable to hardware integration. Our innovative pruning approach not only enhances accuracy and the ability to extract features across different DNN architectures and datasets but also introduces a comprehensive framework for the concurrent extraction of pattern libraries, selection of patterns, and pruning of patterns and connections alongside weight training. Additionally, our pattern-based sparsity methodology integrates seamlessly with compiler optimizations, ensuring highly efficient execution of DNNs on mobile devices."

Constructing a more closely matched control group by matching a subset of the overall control group to the treated group may result in less bias. We study this phenomenon in simulation studies. We study the effect of mountaintop removal mining (mrm) on mortality using a difference-in-differences analysis that makes use of the increase in mrm following the 1990 clean air act amendments. For a difference-in-differences analysis of the effect of mrm on mortality, we constructed a more closely matched control group and found a 95\\% confidence interval that contains substantial adverse effects along with no effect and small beneficial effects.",

Specifically, we investigate the implications of mountaintop removal mining (MRM) on mortality, emphasizing the post-1990 Clean Air Act amendments' influence on MRM proliferation. By crafting a control group better matched to the treated group for our analysis, we identified a 95% confidence interval that spans a range of outcomes, from significantly negative impacts to negligible or minor positive effects on mortality."

As a young reporter, i thought that i should do it in a different way, so that it has a maximum impact, since everybody knew that it was happening, and yet there was nothing that was keeping it out of the system.so i decided to go there and act as a seller.

My narrative unfolds over the past 14 years, beginning when I, fresh out of college and eager as a novice journalist, stumbled upon a story of corruption. This story involved local police accepting bribes from street hawkers. Common knowledge, yet unaddressed, this issue demanded a newsworthy approach for true resonance. I opted for direct involvement, posing as a vendor to gather indisputable evidence. The result was tremendous, resonating widely and exemplifying the power of what's known as immersion or undercover journalism."

When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon makes its way back to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon.but over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock and some becomes fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. And human activities, like burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon.today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year.",
        "gpt4_rewrite_output": "What happens to the vast amounts of carbon emitted by human activities? Carbon is a key component of life's cycle, coursing through living organisms, soil, seas, the air, and underground rocks. As organisms perish, much of their carbon content is released back into the atmosphere, awaiting the growth of new flora for reabsorption. However, over millennia, carbon captured in ancient flora and marine organisms is converted into rock formations, as well as into fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Volcanic eruptions naturally unlock some carbon from these rocks. Contrastingly, human endeavors, including the combustion of fossil fuels, liberate this ancient, sequestered carbon. Remarkably, human-induced carbon emissions dwarf those from volcanoes, with humans releasing about 60 times more carbon annually than the volcanic emissions worldwide."

A distinctive difference between the technology of nature and human invention is durability in diverse and unfamiliar settings. Astoundingly, cockroaches have an innate ability to self-correct their stability while navigating uneven surfaces. Experiments adding jet packs or simulating seismic activity reveal that cockroaches effortlessly maintain equilibrium, thanks to their exquisitely adaptive legs that operate without cognitive input. Their capacity to traverse intricate landscapes such as blades of grass without losing balance showcases their enviable resilience. A recently observed behavior demonstrates that the very shape of cockroaches enables them to roll aside, easing their way through fabricated grassy obstacles.
